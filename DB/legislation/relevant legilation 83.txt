X.        Case Authorities
[48]           Both counsel for the Crown and the defence helpfully provided a number of recent Alberta cases to assist the Court in determining proportionality to the gravity of the offence, the degree of responsibility of the offender (Criminal Code, s 718.1) and parity; in that similar offenders, committing similar offences in similar circumstances, attract both similar sentences and determinations of parole ineligibility (Criminal Code, s 718.2(b)). The cases provided by counsel follow.

A.        R v Shropshire
[49]           The accused pled guilty to second degree murder committed during a marijuana trafficking transaction. Without warning, the accused shot the victim three times in the chest as they were about to complete the drug transaction. Two days later, he gave himself up to police and professed remorse for his actions. However, there was never an explanation as to why the murder had occurred.

[50]           The accused had a prior criminal record including two youth convictions for robbery, a conviction for impaired driving and two narcotic offences as an adult. On the other hand, the accused had pled guilty to the offence.

[51]           The trial judge set the parole ineligibility period at 12 years, but that was reduced by the Court of Appeal to 10 years. The Supreme Court of Canada noted that the median parole ineligibility should be 10 years, but in the absence of any explanation for a random and seemingly senseless killing, the Supreme Court of Canada found the trial judge was correct in increasing that figure to 12 years ineligibility.

B.        R v Bobocel, 2014 ABQB 570, 115 WCB (2d) 625
[52]           The accused pled guilty to second degree murder of his common-law wife on the second day of his trial. He had struck the victim three times in the head with a ball-peen hammer, attempted to clean-up the crime scene, and took the victim’s body to a worksite where he attempted to feed the body into a stump grinder designed for disposal of animal carcasses. The body became entangled in the blade, he left the body partially destroyed, and set his truck on fire to destroy any evidence.

[53]           Mr. Bobocel suffered from a delusional disorder of mixed type, primarily persecution and jealousy type, and there were some Gladue principles of limited relevance. The Court found that he was not eligible to apply for parole until he had served 15 years of his sentence.

C.        R v Martel, 2011 ABCA 225, 510 AR 191, leave denied [2011] SCCA No 557
[54]           The accused caused the death of his common-law wife from one stab wound to her abdomen. He took a video of her dying moments with his cell phone and on that video he was cool, calm, and showed enthusiasm for the wound he had inflicted. He then tried to set up the murder scene to implicate a third party, waited for two hours before calling for help, told the 911 operator that he had arrived home to find the victim dead, had hidden the knife and the bloody clothes, and continued to lie to the police for months until the video was discovered.

[55]           At trial he showed limited remorse for his victim and there were no mitigating factors to off-set aggravating factors. In that case, the Court of Appeal concluded that the 12 year period of parole ineligibility set by the trial judge was unfit, allowed the appeal and substituted a period of 15 years parole ineligibility.

D.        R v Tran, 2009 ABCA 308, 464 AR 272 affirmed on other grounds 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 SCR 350
[56]           The accused entered his former matrimonial home unannounced and uninvited, where his estranged spouse and children lived. He used a copy of a key that he had deceitfully obtained, entered the bedroom and found his estranged spouse in bed with a new boyfriend. He viciously attacked both with knives that he had obtained from the kitchen, killed the boyfriend and severely wounded his estranged spouse. The deceased suffered 37 knife wounds and died from blood loss. The estranged spouse suffered stab wounds to her hands, and a large, serious and disfiguring slash wound to her face. During the attack, the accused threatened to kill his children.

[57]           The Court of Appeal found that where the deceased was stabbed 37 times, was killed during an aggravated assault on an estranged wife with serious injuries leaving her permanently disfigured, and there were threats to kill the children, a 10 year period of parole ineligibility was unfit. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a period of parole ineligibility of 15 years.

E.        R v White, 2006 ABQB 909, 408 AR 64 affirmed on other grounds, 2009 ABCA 115, 448 AR 305
[58]           The accused was found guilty by jury of second degree murder and offering an indignity to the remains of his wife. Mr. White killed his wife in their home by stabbing. She sustained defensive-type slashing wounds to her left hand, some deep wounds in her torso area, and death was likely caused by having her throat cut. Mr. White left his wife’s naked body face down and covered with branches and vegetation in a ditch next to a range road. He cleaned up the scene of the crime and disposed of clothing, surgical gloves and paper towels. He then staged a crime scene northeast of Edmonton with items of identification strewn about the ground under an open driver’s door, organized and led searches, unsuccessfully, for the body of his wife and made pleas through the media for her safe return. He lied to the police about not recognizing his bloodied clothing and sandals when they were later discovered.

[59]           In this case, the Crown counsel sought ineligibility for parole for 20 years, defence counsel argued for a period of ineligibility of 14 years, and the jury recommended a period of ineligibility for parole of 15 years. The Court found that the accused committed “the ultimate act of spousal abuse, while occupying a position of trust” and said that the aggravating factors included the facts that the victim was four months pregnant, there was a young child who would be deprived of his mother, the crime was brutal and callous with obvious evidence of struggle, the accused stripped the body naked, left it to be ravaged by insects and savaging animals, attempted to cover up his crime, staged a fake crime scene, lied to police, led search parties, and enlisted the support of the media in public appeals. As a result, the Court set the period of parole ineligibility at 17 years.

F.         R v Diep, 2005 ABQB 81, affirmed on other grounds 2006 ABCA 148, 70 WCB (2d) 642
[60]           The accused stabbed his former wife once through the chest near the heart while she slept in their former matrimonial bed, on the eve of her departure for a new life with herself and her parents.

[61]           The Court noted that spousal homicide was deserving of a particular censure, was an extreme form of domestic violence and a reprehensible abuse of power and control. The accused had no recent relevant criminal record, no history of spousal abuse, had been the subject of child abuse, and was suffering from depression for months before the incident. After the incident he showed signs of guilt, remorse and became suicidal. The Court found that the offence was committed on the spur of the moment, without planning and by the time of trial the accused had already served 32 months in the Remand Center.

[62]           Crown counsel asked for parole ineligibility to be set between 12 and 15 years, but the Court determined under the circumstances it should be left at the statutory parole eligibility of 10 years.

G.        R v Radonjic, 2004 ABCA 323, 361 AR 204
[63]           The Court of Appeal addressed a trial decision where parole ineligibility had been set by the trial judge at 15 years. The accused murdered his wife while he was facing charges of assault against her, and was the subject of two separate restraining orders. He stabbed her to death in a city street in broad daylight, was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and showed no remorse. He was diagnosed in a psychiatric assessment as being extremely self-absorbed, having a narcissistic personality with paranoid traits, and he indicated that he believed his wife deserved what she got. He did turn himself in immediately after committing the offence and pled guilty.

[64]           The Court was most concerned that the murder was flagrant conduct in the face of outstanding assault charges and restraining orders, and determined to leave the parole ineligibility period at 15 years.

H.        R v Nagel (1 December 2016), Docket No 140489642Q1 (Alta QB)
[65]           The accused was charged with second degree murder of his wife, leaving five children of the marriage between the ages of 10 and 18. He had shared custody of the children. The accused suffered from depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations, and was under medical care.

[66]           The accused parked his vehicle approximately two blocks away from the victim’s house and attended at the house wearing black jogging pants, a black t-shirt, a protective work vest, black socks, black boots, a mask, gloves and goggles, and carrying two knives. Once in the house he also obtained a baseball bat and bicycle lock and hid in the basement laundry room. He left a fake note for the victim and sent her emails to lead her to believe he had taken two of the children to his mother’s house. Early the next morning, he entered the bedroom and observed his wife asleep for a period of time. He then strangled her while she was in bed, and then again once she had fallen onto the floor. He covered the victim’s body with a blanket, barricaded the bedroom door and stabbed himself in the chest with a knife. The next morning, the RCMP attended at the residence, forced open the bedroom door, found the victim dead and took the accused to the hospital where he was sutured, treated for a collapsed lung and fitted with a chest tube for fluid building up around his heart.

[67]           The accused wrote a 41 page confession detailing the death of his spouse. The Crown and defence jointly submitted a 15 year period of parole ineligibility and that was accepted by the Court.

I.         R v Hales, 2014 NSSC 408, 117 WCB (2d) 312
[68]           The accused and victim were husband and wife; their relationship had broken down. The victim was pressing for custody of their three children, and financial support. The accused had a history of physical aggression and violent thoughts towards his wife. He made a detailed plan to lure his wife into a secluded place and repeatedly stabbed her with a knife, leaving her to bleed to death. The accused had no criminal record, no history of substance or alcohol abuse and was gainfully employed with the Canadian Navy. He had suffered from acute anxiety and depression since helping out in New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

[69]           He accepted responsibility as indicated by his guilty plea, although two years after the murder, and did indicate remorse. The Crown and defence made a joint recommendation for parole ineligibility for a period of 17 years and the Court accepted that joint submission.

J.         R v Ryan
[70]           The accused was a drug trafficker addicted to crack cocaine. He employed the victim to sell drugs for him. The victim stole the accused’s cocaine and truck, and bragged about this exploit. The accused tracked down the victim and shot him in the head. The victim’s body was dumped in the bush and the accused attempted to destroy the truck by pouring gasoline in the cab and lighting it. He also threw the hunting rifle into the bush and reported the truck as being stolen.

[71]           The accused was charged with first degree murder, did not plead guilty, and was convicted after trial of second degree murder. The accused was in pre-sentence custody for 44 months and had a significant criminal record both before and after this murder.

[72]           On appeal, counsel for the offender recommended 12 years and counsel for the Crown 22 years for parole ineligibility. The trial judge began his calculation of parole ineligibility at 15 years, increased that to 17 years as a result of the disposal of the body, and then reduced it once again, improperly, by pre-sentence custody and by an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter, which was not accepted by the Crown, to 13 years.

[73]           In increasing this parole ineligibility period to 17 years, Picard JA took into consideration the gravity of the crime, the degree of culpability and individual responsibility of the offender, and the surrounding circumstances, and considered the factors that might increase or decrease the period of parole ineligibility, putting some emphasis on the fact that this was a drug enforcement slaying.

[74]           Wakeling JA placed this murder into his third category of second degree murders, those which should invite parole ineligibility between 20 and 25 years, and he selected 23 years as a starting point. He concurred however with the opinion of Picard JA that parole ineligibility period could be reduced to 17 years.

[75]           The variation in range of the above sentences is apparent, but also understandable, for the simple reason that each case and each offender are different, and to a large extent, the period of parole ineligibility will be determined by the particular mitigating and aggravating circumstances.
