[12]                              On 26 September 2014, border services officers Holly Golding and Jaime Johnston were working at the St. Croix, New Brunswick, US-Canada border crossing.  A dark colored half-ton pick-up truck with US license plates stopped at the border crossing and Ms. Golding recognized the driver as Colin Kilbride.  It was her evidence that he was a frequent traveler but the passenger identified as Louis Raymond Debly was not familiar to her.  When questioned, Mr. Kilbride explained that the vehicle had US plates because it was a company vehicle and he told Golding that they had been absent from Canada for a couple of hours and that he had no goods to declare.  Mr. Debly at that point did declare some goods described as tractor parts with a value of $5,186.00.



[13]                              Ms. Golding scanned a computer identification document provided by Mr. Kilbride and Mr. Debly and the computer flagged Mr. Debly as having been the subject in the past of seizures and more particularly that he had gone abroad and failed to disclose that he had with him currency of over $10,000.00.  Because Mr. Debly was flagged, Ms. Golding then had to do a secondary examination.  She informed both Mr. Debly and Mr. Kilbride that the vehicle would be searched while Mr. Debly was inside the border crossing building paying the duties and taxes on the tractor parts that he had declared.  During the search, Ms. Golding found what appeared to be 30 round capacity magazines and additional items suspected to be prohibited firearms parts.  Ms. Golding described these items as being wrapped separately in grey paper and neatly packed in the hidden compartment of the center console.  Ms. Golding and Mr. Johnston contacted their supervisor for assistance and they continued to search the vehicle wherein they found an open box of items of Mr. Kilbride’s and another box marked “Midway USA” which contained additional firearm parts.



[14]                              Neither Mr. Debly nor Mr. Kilbride claimed the goods that were found and in fact, Mr. Kilbride told the Border Services Officers that he did not know who the box belonged to and that it could have been left behind by someone who had driven the company car previously.  The undeclared goods were inventoried and seized and Mr. Debly provided some cash to Mr. Kilbride to pay a penalty of $500.00 in relation to the vehicle.



[15]                              There was a further investigation by Frederick Kinney, Border Services Officer, and in the end it was his decision that they had reason to believe that the items were purchased from US companies and he obtained a production order for the purpose of determining whether the purchase had been made by a CIBC card holder from the US.  The Border Services Officers believed that Mr. Debly’s card had been used.  In the end, Mr. Kinney was asked why the investigation centered more on Mr. Debly than Mr. Kilbride and he indicated that it appeared that the seized items were purchased with Mr. Debly’s credit card.
