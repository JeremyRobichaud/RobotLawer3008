With the advent of the Charter and as a result of various decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, the substantive adequacy of Informations has quite legitimately become a major focus of debate in criminal trials where the admissibility of evidence obtained as a result of a search warrant is challenged. It is perhaps opportune to outline some of the general principles which govern the review process which trial judges must undertake in such cases. a) General Principles [10] The fact that Informations are subject to judicial scrutiny before a search warrant can be validly issued and the fact that the issuing judge's ultimate decision involves an exercise of discretion explain, at least in part, why any subsequent review must be undertaken from the standpoint that the impugned search warrant and Information are presumed valid. See Fontana, The Law of Search and Seizure in Canada (4th Ed.) (Toronto: Butterworths, 1997) at 72. Since the Information is presumed valid, it follows that the

burden rests on the challenger to satisfy the reviewing judge that it does not comply with the substantive requirements set by law. [11] Moreover, the reviewing court must not assess the substantive quality of the Information by confining itself to the evidence which is explicitly set out in it. The court must bear in mind the undoubted power of the issuing judge to draw reasonable inferences from such explicitly stated evidence. This power has been recognized by our court on several occasions. See R. v. MacDonald (F.D.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2806 (NB CA), 128 N.B.R.(2d) 447; 332 A.P.R. 447 (C.A.), and Valley Equipment Ltd. v. R. (1998), 1998 CanLII 12245 (NB CA), 198 N.B.R.(2d) 211; 506 A.P.R. 211 (C.A.). It has also been acknowledged by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the oft-quoted case of R. v. Breton (M.) (1994), 1994 CanLII 939 (ON CA), 74 O.A.C. 99; 93 C.C.C.(3d) 171 (C.A.). In that case, the court had no hesitation in deciding that the issuing judge had the power to draw the inference from the stated evidence that a particular individual had committed an offence, and that a narcotic was present at a particular location. It is settled law that the issuing judge is fully empowered to make all reasonable deductions which flow logically from the evidence stated in the Information, and this power must be factored into the review process. [12] Furthermore, the assessment by the reviewing court must take into account the totality of the Information, interpreting its constituent parts in context. See R. v. Arason (R.H.) and Derosier (G.L.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 1008 (BC CA), 21 B.C.A.C. 20; 37 W.A.C. 20; 78 C.C.C.(3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 25. It is therefore inappropriate to subject the Information to a microscopic analysis of its individual parts,

each part being then viewed in isolation from its context. [13] Finally, an overly strict interpretation of the words used in the Information is not warranted by the jurisprudence, or by s. 8 of the Charter. This is particularly so where, as here, the evidence is uncontroverted that the deponent has acted in good faith throughout, and there is no evidence of fraud, reckless disregard for the truth, deliberate non-disclosure or intentional misstatement of the evidence. The reviewing court should be alive to the fact that, in most cases, the deponent is not trained in the niceties and subtleties of legal drafting. In this regard, I fully endorse the views expressed by Gibbs, J.A., in R. v. Melenchuk (R.) et al. (1993), 1993 CanLII 1011 (BC CA), 24 B.C.A.C. 97; 40 W.A.C. 97 (C.A.), at para. 15: "[15] ... It would be impractical to expect of an officer swearing an information in these circumstances the precise prose of an Oxford grammarian, the detailed disclosures of a confessional and the legal knowledge of a Rhodes scholar." [14] That being said, the reviewing court must remain vigilant and not allow its tolerance for drafting errors or deficiencies to extend to material omissions with respect to substantive requirements. It is indeed trite law that a warrant should only be issued where there is a credibly based probability that the items to be searched for are in the place specified in it. Where the Information does not expressly or by implication disclose the required reasonable grounds, the resulting warrant cannot be said to have been properly issued, and any search conducted under its

authority can be challenged on the basis that it was not authorized by law. See R. v. Caslake (T.L.), 1998 CanLII 838 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51; 221 N.R. 281; 123 Man.R.(2d) 208; 159 W.A.C. 208; 121 C.C.C.(3d) 97, at p. 60 [S.C.R.].
