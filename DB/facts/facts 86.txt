[1]               Randy Osei-Agyemang was charged as follows:

 

That he, on or about the 29th day of January A.D. 2008, at or near Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, did unlawfully cause the death of Clifton Anderson, thereby committing first degree murder, contrary to Section 235(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

[2]               Mr. Osei-Agyemang elected to be tried by a Court composed of a Judge and Jury. The trial commenced on Monday, June 1, 2009 and the Crown’s case closed the morning of Wednesday, June 3, 2009. Mr. Osei-Agyemang elected not to call any evidence.

 


[3]               Counsel for the Crown and counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang addressed the jury on June 8, and I delivered my charge to the jury on June 9. Later that evening, after deliberating for almost eight hours, the jury found Mr. Osei-Agyemang not guilty of the original charge but guilty of second degree murder. As a result of the jury’s finding, Mr. Osei-Agyemang was automatically sentenced to imprisonment for life pursuant to Section 745(c) of the Criminal Code of Canada. The jury declined to make a recommendation regarding parole ineligibility.

 

[4]               The issue for determination is what is the proper term of parole ineligibility.

 

[5]               Counsel for the Crown argued that the proper period was in the range of twelve to fifteen years. Counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang argued that he should be entitled to apply for parole after the expiry of the statutory minimum of ten years.

 

[6]               To support his submissions, counsel for the Crown cited the following cases:

 

R. v. Song, 2007 ABQB 37; R. v. Shopshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 129 D.L.R. (4th) 657 (SCC)

 

[7]               Counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang cited the following authorities in the course of his submission:

 

R. v. Shopshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 129 D.L.R. (4th) 657 (SCC); R. v. Diep, 2005 CarswellAlta 151; R. v. Goodstoney, 2008 ABCA 401

 

[8]               Crown counsel also argued for the imposition of a Weapons Prohibition Order pursuant to Section 109 of the Criminal Code of Canada and for a DNA Order pursuant to Section 487.051. Counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang did not argue against either of these requests.

 

[9]               For the reasons set out hereafter, I set the period of parole ineligibility to be fourteen years.

 

Issue

 

[10]           The issue to be decided is what is the proper period of parole ineligibility that should be imposed.

 

Facts

 

[11]           Mr. Osei-Agyemang was born February 1, 1988. He was therefore just a few days shy of his twentieth birthday at the time he murdered Clifton Anderson.

 

[12]           Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s criminal record was entered as an exhibit in the sentencing hearing. It comprises convictions both in Youth Court and in Adult Court. It is a lengthy and serious criminal record, particularly having regard to Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s young age. Neither counsel sought either a Pre-Sentence Report or a forensic assessment of Mr. Osei-Agyemang.


 

[13]           The facts giving rise to Clifton Anderson’s murder are briefly summarized as follows.

 

[14]           On the evening of January 28, 2008, Mr. Osei-Agyemang, together with eventually six other young people, gathered at the residence owned by the mother of Jordan, Shawna and Quinn Faulkner, who were in attendance that evening. In addition, friends of the Faulkners, Chantelle and Dylan Mackay were present, as was Clifton Anderson.

 

[15]           Three 40-ounce bottles of beer were consumed by six of the seven young people present at the time (Quinn Faulkner did not arrive home until after the beer had been consumed). Later on, a bottle of Crown Royal rye was purchased and in short order consumed by the seven individuals who were then present.

 

[16]           A game of strip poker ensued played by six of the seven young people (the oldest Faulkner sibling, Jordan, having gone to his bedroom downstairs to get a night’s sleep).

 

[17]           Mr. Osei-Agyemang was the first person to leave the game of strip poker. He went downstairs to talk on the phone. Others left the game and eventually, there were only three people left playing, those being Shawna Faulkner, Chantelle Mackay and Clifton Anderson. In due course, Shawna and Clifton went into her bedroom together in a semi-naked state.

 

[18]           Quinn Faulkner, along with Dylan Mackay, went downstairs to advise Mr. Osei-Agyemang what was going on between Shawna Faulkner and Clifton Anderson. This news was not well received by Mr. Osei-Agyemang. He felt that by doing this, Clifton Anderson was disrespecting Shawna’s older brother Jordan. In addition, he had feelings of his own towards Shawna.

 

[19]           At trial, Quinn Faulkner testified that Mr. Osei-Agyemang said words to the effect that he would have to teach Anderson a lesson. Mr. Osei-Agyemang then openly debated whether he should punch Anderson, shank him (that is to say, stab him) or to take the nearby baseball bat to him. Quinn suggested to Mr. Osei-Agyemang, that given those options, that he should employ the least violent one, that is, to assault him.

 

[20]           Mr. Osei-Agyemang resolved the debate he was having with himself by deciding to stab Anderson. To that end, he obtained his knife, stabbed it into the nearby sofa cushion and then put it into his back pocket. He proceeded upstairs and entered the bedroom advising Anderson that he should leave.

 

[21]           Anderson initially demurred, but Mr. Osei-Agyemang insisted and said that he together with Dylan Mackay would walk Anderson to the bus. Mr. Osei-Agyemang and Anderson then got dressed to go outside (it being extremely cold that evening) and then exited the residence with Dylan Mackay.

 


[22]           Dylan Mackay could only hear a part of the conversation that ensued between Mr. Osei-Agyemang and Anderson but did hear Mr. Osei-Agyemang ask Anderson “was it worth it” to which Anderson responded “no, not really”. Mackay then turned around to see Mr. Osei-Agyemang striking Anderson who quickly fell to the ground. It was only on their way back into the house, that Dylan Mackay realized that instead of merely striking him, that Mr. Osei-Agyemang had stabbed Anderson instead.

 

[23]           After coming back into the house, Mr. Osei-Agyemang in due course advised everyone that he had killed Anderson and indeed he laughed when he told Shawna Faulkner that this was probably his first murder. Enlisting the assistance of some of the others, Mr. Osei-Agyemang proceeded to wash the knife and then hide it. He also arranged to clean the blue jeans he had been wearing.

 

[24]           The evidence of Dr. Andrews, the Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Alberta, was that there was a total of seven stab wounds to Clifton Anderson’s body as well as two incised wounds. Dr. Andrews testified that there were two stab wounds to Clifton Anderson’s chest, either one of which was or would have been fatal within seconds.
