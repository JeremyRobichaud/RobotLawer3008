6.                     On September 11, 2018 at approximately 4:20 p.m., the Woodstock Detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were dispatched as a result of a 911 call received from Amon Kelleter, who reported a dead body at his parents’ residence in Jacksonville, New Brunswick.



7.                     Initially, the 911 dispatch received by the RCMP indicated it was a case of a “sudden death”.  Shortly thereafter it was clarified that the death had likely been by stabbing, or words to that effect.



8.                     At this point, numerous RCMP officers responded to the scene.  Constable Whiteway and Constable Tremblay were the first two police officers to arrive on scene followed almost immediately behind by ambulance first responders.



9.                     Constable Whiteway first entered the residence through the side door and called out to anyone inside.  A man, later determined to be Amon Kelleter, replied, “I’m here” or “In here”.  It appeared that Amon Kelleter was administering CPR on a female body (later identified to be Destiny Anderson) at the time.



10.                  Constable Tremblay observed the female with unbuttoned jeans, which exposed her underwear.  It was also observed the female had no shoes or shirt on.  Her bra was pulled over the top of her breasts.  The female was lying on the floor with her head near a computer desk on the main floor of the house.



11.                  Constable Whiteway requested Amon Kelleter to remove three dogs from the main floor area who were acting agitated.  Amon Kelleter complied with the request and took the dogs upstairs away from the first responders.



12.                  Constable Tremblay, who had earlier cleared the upstairs, followed Amon Kelleter upstairs, where they placed the dogs in one of the bedrooms.  While upstairs, Constable Tremblay requested Amon Kelleter to provide certain “tombstone information” such as Mr. Kelleter’s name, date of birth, and contact information.



13.                  Relatively shortly thereafter, other police officers arrived.  Two of those were Constable Gionet and Corporal Van Dijk, who both entered the residence.



14.                  Both officers, after some initial review of the scene downstairs, proceeded upstairs where they observed Constable Tremblay conversing with the accused.  While their accounts differed to some degree, both officers indicated they observed a scratch on the accused’s face across his nose and cheek.  Based on these observations, Corporal Van Dijk and Constable Gionet determined that Mr. Kelleter should then be detained.



15.                  At approximately 4:38 p.m. Constable Gionet detained Amon Kelleter as part of the investigation into the murder of Destiny Anderson.  Constable Gionet read him the police caution from his standard issued blue card.  After advising Amon Kelleter he was being detained as part of a murder investigation, Constable Gionet asked the accused, “Do you understand,” and the accused replied, “I do”.



16.                  Constable Gionet next informed the accused of his right to legal counsel, including through Legal Aid, from the standard issued blue card.  The accused stated he understood.  When asked what he wanted to do about his right to contact a lawyer the accused replied, “I want to contact Legal Aid”.  Constable Gionet then placed Amon Kelleter into handcuffs.



17.                  Next, the accused was brought downstairs and placed in the back of Constable Gionet’s police car.  Efforts were then undertaken to attempt to find a work issued cellphone in order to facilitate Mr. Kelleter’s telephone call to a Legal Aid lawyer.



18.                  It was while Constable Gionet was in the car with Amon Kelleter that Mr. Kelleter began to explain what happened.  While Constable Gionet told Mr. Kelleter he did not have to speak any further, Mr. Kelleter went on to volunteer that he had gone out to take the dogs for a walk for about 20 minutes, and when he returned he found Ms. Anderson lying on the floor stabbed, or words to this effect.  He also indicated that she was not there before he left and that “someone must have followed her there and stabbed her”.



19.                  By 4:53 p.m. and in light of this and other information, Constable Gionet had formed the grounds for the arrest of Amon Kelleter for the murder of Destiny Anderson.  Constable Gionet advised Amon Kelleter that he was now being arrested for her murder and asked if the accused understood.  The accused replied, “Yes”.



20.                  Constable Gionet then read the accused, once again, the police caution from the standard issued blue card.  When asked if he understood, the accused replied, “Yes”, and he then went on to ask, “Is that bad?”



21.                  Next, Constable Gionet read Mr. Kelleter his right to counsel from the standard blue card, and after which he stated he understood.  When asked what he wanted to do about his right to contact a lawyer, the accused replied, “I want to call Legal Aid”.



22.                  At this point, Constable Gionet transported Mr. Kelleter to the Woodstock RCMP Detachment, which is a relatively short distance away.  Upon arrival, the accused was processed with officers taking pictures of him and seizing his clothing.  They provided him a paper jumpsuit to wear.  Constable Tremblay and Corporal Manuel assisted with the processing.



23.                  Following this processing, Constable Gionet escorted the accused to the interview room to wait for a call from Legal Aid.  At approximately 5:15 p.m. Legal Aid was contacted and a lawyer, Julian Williams, called back.  Given the seriousness of the issue, Mr. Williams referred the call to his supervisor.  At 5:21 p.m. Peter Corey, Director of Criminal Services for Legal Aid, called back.  Constable Gionet handed the accused the phone and then left the room.



24.                  Mr. Kelleter’s phone call with Mr. Corey lasted approximately 20 minutes.  Following the conversation, Mr. Kelleter was asked by Constable Gionet whether he was satisfied with the advice received and Mr. Kelleter indicated that he was.



25.                  Next, at 5:47 p.m., Constable Tremblay, with the assistance of Corporal Manuel, attended the interview room to take a swab of blood from the accused’s foot which had been noted earlier.  The accused was then placed in a cell at the RCMP Woodstock Detachment.



26.                  Corporal Mark Blakely of the RCMP Major Crime Unit was next tasked with interviewing Amon Kelleter.  Corporal Blakely arrived from Fredericton at the RCMP Woodstock Detachment at approximately 7:00 p.m. on September 11th.



27.                  Corporal Blakely confirmed that Mr. Kelleter had been provided with food and water.  He introduced himself to Amon Kelleter and he arranged for Mr. Kelleter to be provided a pizza pocket.  Corporal Blakely also arranged for clothing for Amon Kelleter.



28.                  At 9:15 p.m. Corporal Blakely started recording an interview with the accused.  A secondary police caution was read which included the advice to the accused that he should not feel compelled to say anything further, nor should the fact he may have spoken earlier to police, influence his decision to speak again, or words to that effect.  Mr. Kelleter indicated that he understood.  Mr. Kelleter was not handcuffed or restrained.  Corporal Blakely did not have his sidearm or handcuffs with him during all interview times.  This initial interview continued until approximately 10:23 p.m.



29.                  Following the interview, Mr. Kelleter was placed back into his cell and provided with another meal and time to rest.



30.                  At approximately 12:12 a.m. on September 12th Corporal Blakely and Amon Kelleter returned to the interview room to continue some questioning.  This interview ended at 12:46 a.m. and Mr. Kelleter was placed back into the cell.



31.                  A subsequent video interview with Amon Kelleter was conducted at 9:58 a.m. on September 12th and that interview concluded at 10:23 a.m.
