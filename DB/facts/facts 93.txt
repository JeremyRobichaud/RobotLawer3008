[3]        Counsel were able to agree on a large number of evidentiary matters as reflected in the Agreed Statement of Facts. The narrative portion of that Agreement includes the following:


 

 


 

1.                                                      A.A. (“the Accused”) was born [...]. 1990 and was 17 years old at the time of the events set out below. He used two cell phones prior to his arrest: 780  819 0666 and 780 996 9667. Both were registered under W.A.’s name and paid for by him.

 

2.                                                      The Accused was friends with D.B. (born on February 21, 1991) who was 16 years old at the time of the events described below. He does not have a cell phone.

 

3.                                                      The victim, W.A., was the accused’s paternal uncle. He was also known as Alberto. Prior to his death he used a cell phone with the number 780 819 9888.

 

4.                                                      All events described herein occurred in the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, Canada.

 

            Events

 

5.                                                      W.A. was a major dealer of cocaine in Edmonton. The Accused assisted him by chopping bulk cocaine into smaller quantities at W.A.’s residence at Suite 206, [...] – 107 Street (“W.A.’s Residence”). The Accused was assisted by his friend, K.M., with W.A.’s knowledge and approval. D.B. sometimes assisted the Accused in chopping the cocaine, without W.A.’s knowledge.

 

6.                                                      Prior to November 24, 2007, the Accused resided at Suite 305, [...] – 100 Street, a suite controlled by W.A. On the night of November 23, 2007, the Accused and several friends were at this suite. W.A. attended and stated that he was missing two ounces of cocaine. He took cash from the Accused and evicted him from the suite.

 

7.                                                      The Accused continued to use the suite sporadically but also stayed at D.B.’s family home at 15123 –118th St., Edmonton.

 

8.                                                      On November 28, 2007, K.M. made an anonymous telephone call to the Edmonton Police Service, in the presence of the Accused and D.B. K.M. stated that a person known as Alberto was dealing drugs from W.A.’s Residence. The police did not act on that information.

 

9.                                                      At 8:12 p.m. on November 30, 2007 the Accused sent a text message to W.A. offering to chop cocaine for him. W.A. was at a downtown restaurant and they arranged to meet so that the Accused could get the keys to W.A.’s Residence.  The Accused sent a text message confirming that he was on his way at 10 p.m.

 

10.                                                  The Accused and D.B. took a Co-Op taxicab from D.B.’s residence to the restaurant where the Accused obtained the keys to W.A.’s Residence shortly after 10 p.m. D.B. waited outside.

 

11.                                                  The Accused and D.B. then walked to W.A.’s Residence and gained entry to it using the keys provided by W.A. The Accused and D.B. located the following items and placed them in a duffel bag:

 

a.                  2054 grams of cocaine;

b.                  five bags of marijuana with a total weight of 1135 grams;

c.                  $24,000 in cash.

 

12.                                                  They located the keys and the PIN to two South Edmonton Storage units, units A0039 and A0045. These units were rented under fictitious names, but paid for and controlled by W.A. Between 11:12 p.m. and 11:14 p.m., the Accused made 13 calls to Co-op Taxis (780 425 2525). The Accused and D.B. were collected by a Co-op Taxi driven by Najim Palani at 11:24 p.m.

 

13.                                                  The Accused and D.B. took the taxi to South Edmonton Storage. Surveillance video shows an individual in dark clothing opening the gate. The gate to the storage compound was opened at 11:49 p.m. using the PIN obtained from W.A.’s Residence. Storage unit A0039 and A0045 were opened at 11:49 p.m and 11:51 p.m. respectively using the keys taken from W.A.’s Residence. The times are recorded on the site activity records which are two minutes slow.

 

14.                                                  Locker A0039 contained cash. Locker A0045 contained two 7.62 mm Norinco SKS–D semi-automatic rifles and one 9mm Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol. One of the SKS–D rifles (“the Rifle”) was selected. The Rifle is a firearm as defined by the Criminal Code of Canada. The Rifle's serial number had been removed.  D.B. and the Accused intended to return for the cash located in locker A0039 later.

 

15.                                                  The Rifle was placed in a blue duffel bag also found in the locker. The Accused and D.B. left the South Edmonton Storage's compound at 12:17 a.m. on December 1, 2007. The blue duffel bag used to transport the Rifle was later found by the police on the landing in W.A.’s apartment building.

 

16.                                                  Between 12:20 and 12:21 a.m. the Accused made 11 calls to Co-op Taxis. The Accused and D.B. were collected by Co-op Taxi driven by Abdul Rajab at approximately 12:28 a.m. He took the Accused and D.B. to W.A.’s apartment building, and they entered W.A.’s Residence at approximately 1:00 a.m. on December 1, 2007.

 

17.                                                  Given that W.A. had not returned home, the Accused and D.B. became impatient and left the suite before he arrived. They took a spare set of keys with them, leaving W.A.’s set under the mat for him.

 

18.                                                  On exiting the apartment complex, they hid the bag containing the drugs and money, and went to a nearby parking lot.

 

19.                                                  At 2:27 a.m. the Accused called W.A.’s cell phone.

 

20.                                                  D.B. and the Accused subsequently approached W.A.’s Residence together. At 3:33 and 3:34 a.m. W.A. called the Accused’s cell phone, but the Accused did not answer. One of the two knocked on the door at approximately 3:35 a.m. When W.A. opened the door a single shot was fired. Very shortly after that a further six shots were fired through the closed door. These bullets were fired from the Rifle.

 

21.                                                  Police attended at the scene at [...]–107 Street at approximately 5:23 a.m. and found seven spent rifle shell casings in the hallway immediately outside W.A.’s Residence as well as six bullet holes in the door to the Residence. W.A.’s body was located lying on the floor behind the door.

 

22.                                                  W.A. sustained one gunshot wound to his right arm and two to his abdomen. He died on December 1, 2007 as a result of blood loss due to multiple gunshot wounds, as stated in the autopsy report prepared by Dr. Bernard Bannach.

 

23.                                                  The Accused and D.B. ran out of the back door of the building and down the lane located directly behind the apartment complex. The Rifle was concealed between 10248 and 10242–106 Street, 40 meters from the rear entrance of the apartment complex.

 

24.                                                  The ski goggles D.B. wore at the time of the offence were recovered from a loading dock in the alley behind W.A.’s apartment building. D.B.'s gloves were located in a dumpster nearby.

 

25.                                                  The Accused and D.B. retrieved the bag containing the drugs and cash previously taken from W.A.’s Residence. They briefly visited the Accused’s former apartment at [...] –100 Street. The Accused called for a Co-op Taxi at 4:39 a.m., but both he and D.B. flagged down a Yellow Cab taxi at approximately 4:43 a.m. and took it to the D.B. family home. There the duffel bag with the cash and drugs was hidden behind the furnace in the basement.

 

26.                                                  During an interview with Detective McCormack, prior to his arrest, the Accused volunteered to turn over the drugs taken from W.A.’s Residence, on the understanding that he would not be prosecuted in relation to drug offences. He accompanied police to the D.B. family home and retrieved the drugs from the duffel bag behind the basement furnace and handed the drugs to police.

 

27.                                                  Police subsequently located $24,000 in cash in the duffel bag as well as a pair of goggles. Police also recovered four keys, two for W.A.’s apartment complex and one each for storage lockers A0039 and A0045 at South Edmonton Storage, which were subsequently found to contain a 7.62 mm Norinco SKS – D semi-automatic rifle, a 9 mm Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol, and a large amount of cash stored in cardboard boxes, including 18 bundles of $100 notes.

 

28.                                                  Police interviewed both the Accused and D.B. In an interview with Detective Clark on December 1, 2007 D.B. admitted to involvement in W.A.’s murder.  The Crown initially gave notice of its intention to seek an adult sentence in relation to D.B. D.B. was subsequently sentenced as a youth and the Crown did not oppose his youth sentence.


 

 

[4]        Expert Reports were attached to the Agreed Facts.  A DNA report dated September 5, 2008 rendered a partial male DNA profile from the magazine found in the Rifle for which later tests excluded the Accused and the deceased. As confirmed by the forensic identification officer, Sgt. Morgan, a gunshot residue analysis reported a single particle characteristic of gunshot residue on the white coat worn by D.B. 

 

[5]        No residue was found on the other article tested (“MM30") although it is not entirely clear that the Accused wore this item. Ms. Simms seemed to identify it as worn by the “taller guy”, but it is labelled in the photos as D.B.’s. It was not a physical exhibit at trial. What is clear is that only the white coat came back with the single gunshot residue as noted.

 

[6]        Various exhibits were also entered without objection, including: a large volume of photographs, the Rifle, two sets of goggles, some clothing articles of both youths and a surveillance video from South Side Storage. It does not appear that police located any gloves worn by the Accused on that night.

 

 

Oral Evidence

 

[7]        In addition to Sgt. Morgan, the Crown called three witnesses: D.B., Erica Simms and K.M. As there is no dispute about the credibility of Ms. Simms, I will deal briefly with her testimony. She worked as a server at Metro Billiards located across the alley from the victim W.A.’s building, Beatty Apartments. Having finished her shift she went out to start her vehicle some time after 3 a.m. and was on or near the stairway of the back entrance when she heard loud noises, like bangs or gunshots. She then saw two younger guys barreling down the back stairs of Beatty Apartments, out into the alley with a gun. 

 

[8]        Ms. Simms identified the taller one as dressed in dark clothes and the smaller one as wearing a white hoody with a red stripe. She confirmed generally that their appearance was similar to what she was shown of the surveillance video of two persons at South Side Storage the same night. She could not say for certain who was carrying the gun but thought the taller one had it in the alley. On cross examination she eventually confirmed her initial statement to police that her impression was that possibly the guy in white had the gun on the stairs and it switched hands.  In the alley perhaps 15 feet away from her, the two kids walked briskly, then crouched and waited as if someone might come out of the building. After a few seconds of pausing they walked further away and she went inside her workplace.

 

[9]        The evidence of both D.B. and K.M. must be approached carefully, although for somewhat different reasons. I will deal with each separately before turning to the context in which their testimony is most germane.

 

[10]      D.B. gave a full chronology of his recollection of events particularly dealing with the night of the shooting and the roles which he and the Accused played. He stated that he met the Accused through K.M. in the summer of 2007. He met the victim W.A. briefly in August and again in September of 2007 but he neither had dealings with W.A. nor any discussions of working for him. Unlike K.M., D.B. cut cocaine with the Accused without the knowledge or approval of W.A. He was close by and found out almost immediately when the Accused was evicted from the apartment by his uncle, which led to the Accused staying at the home of D.B.’s parents.

 

[11]      D.B. says he overheard the Accused and K.M. talk about killing W.A. to take over his drug business. He testified that K.M. offered to do it for $5000. He also testified that the Accused asked him to break into W.A.’s place to get a key for the lockup where they could get a gun to kill W.A. His recall was that two calls were made to Crime Stoppers. On the first K.M. took the phone, they were put on hold and they hung up after 15 minutes. The next day they phoned again and, according to D.B. the Accused provided details about W.A. and was told police would make “inquirements” about the information.

 

[12]      Turning to D.B.’s account of the night of the shooting, he said that he was to fill in for K.M. and provide support for $4000 or $5000. He confirmed that the Accused arranged to pick up apartment keys from W.A. at the restaurant on the pretext of cutting drugs. He also described the bag of money, the storage keys and drugs they took, the trip to get the gun from storage and the waiting for W.A. to come home.

 

[13]      After the shooting D.B. says he exited the back door with the Accused right behind him.  He saw two women smoking right across the alley as he and the Accused continued down the alley to dispose of gloves, goggles and the gun. None of this evidence was at significant odds with the Agreed Statement. What is central is whether D.B.’s account of planning and deliberation, as well as who fired the gun at W.A., is credible. I will return to these points shortly.

 

[14]      K.M. had known the Accused for about 10 years but they became closer friends in early 2007. Although he started cutting drugs without W.A.’s knowledge some time in March that year, by April W.A. agreed to let him be involved. K.M. also confirmed the eviction of the Accused because 2 ounces of cocaine was missing from this apartment that W.A. kept as a safe house for storage of at least some drugs. K.M. said he was at the apartment and described W.A. as having a really angry tone but also stated that he stayed calm. K.M. thought this was 5 days at most before the shooting which is a few days shorter than the Agreed Facts.
