The facts are not in dispute.  The charge against Mr. Baiani and Mr. Simpson arose out of an RCMP investigation called J-Tornado, which targeted drug traffickers in the Saint John are.  Their roles were limited to serving as “runners” for others engaged in drug trafficking.  Mr. Baiani and Mr. Simpson would separately pick-up cocaine from a supplier in Moncton and deliver it to participants in the J-Tornado enterprise in Saint John in exchange for cash.  They accepted the accuracy of the facts set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts submitted to the Court by the Crown and marked as Exhibit C-1.  This factual summary sets out details of Mr. Baiani’s and Mr. Simpson’s trips to Saint John to deliver cocaine and pick-up cash.  It discloses that over the period June 30, 2014 – July 30, 2014 Mr. Simpson made three deliveries of cocaine (1.25 kilograms in total) and Mr. Baiani made one delivery of 1 kilogram of cocaine into the Saint John area.
