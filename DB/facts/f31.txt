The facts

 

[5]        An Agreed Statement of Facts was filed with the court and read into the record.  I do not intend to repeat those facts except to note the following:

 

1.         On April 5, 2013, the date of the assault, unlawful confinement, and threats, Palmer had consumed approximately 16 beer before the incident began.

 

2.         At approximately 10:00 p.m. on April 5, 2013, Palmer became irate at S.D.C.’s admission of infidelity and proceeded to call her vile names and made numerous threats that he would kill her.  This occurred in the kitchen and when the complainant tried to move, Palmer grabbed her by the shoulders and took her to the floor whereupon she struck her head.

 

3.         The proceedings then moved from the kitchen to the livingroom where he slapped her across the face when she tried to move.  He cornered her and hit her a few times, all the while continuing to call her names.  At one point he pulled her hair and had her on the ground, holding her arms and holding her head.

 

4.         The altercation then moved from the livingroom to the upstairs bedroom where Palmer grabbed the complainant by the arm, squeezing her such as to leave a large bruise from her shoulder to her elbow.

 

5.         The abuse levelled by Palmer on the complainant continued for the succeeding hours until approximately 5:30 a.m.  At that time the complainant was able to flee the premises.

 

6.         The complainant could not count the number of times she had been struck during the course of this altercation. 

 

7.         In a cautioned statement to the police, Palmer admitted the assault and was released on an undertaking to have no contact with S.D.C.  Notwithstanding that, he did have contact with her on January 6, 2014 and it was subsequently revealed that they both resumed cohabitation in October, 2013, but that resumption of contact between them actually occurred in August, 2013.

 

[6]        To say that the facts giving rise to the present charges are serious is an understatement.  But for S.D.C.’s timely exit from the premises, much more serious harm could have come to her.  I dare say given Palmer’s irate state and consumption of alcohol on the date in question, as may be gleaned from the facts before me, S.D.C. may not have survived the night.

 

Victim Impact Statement

 

[7]        I must take into consideration S.D.C.’s  Victim Impact Statement.  It was provided on May 1 and May 7, 2013.  She described her physical injuries at that time as suffering from a very sore and tender jaw; a large goose egg on the back of her head; soreness of her head and face; headaches and so on.  She was advised she had sustained a concussion and her hearing was affected for several days.  She was left with a big bruise and swollen mark on her arm.  In addition, as a result of the assault, she lost hair. 

 

[8]        The psychological effects on the complainant are even more disturbing.  She expressed ongoing fear of the accused; inability to sleep; and expressed that she thought she was going to die on the night of the assault.  She described Palmer as a manipulative person and that causes her fear as well.  The proof of this may be in the fact they subsequently resumed cohabitation in August and/or October, 2013.  Nevertheless, in her statement in May, she expressed she didn’t want to see Palmer ever again, but at the same time she was blaming herself, in part, for what happened - probably because of the admission of her infidelity.

 

[9]        In short, the Victim Impact Statement suggests that while S.D.C. may fully recover from the physical injuries inflicted upon her by Palmer, the psychological injuries are not so easily dismissed.
