[5]                           From the evidence, it appears this was a high stress, high conflict, high mental issues, household.  E.C.’s mother B.C. stated the Defendant, a truck driver, suffered from depression, was diagnosed as homicidal and suicidal, and went to doctors in Ontario and a psychiatrist in Nova Scotia.  In his testimony, the Defendant agreed he had had therapy and counselling for depression.  He said he had homicidal and suicidal thoughts, and stated he takes medication for this.

 

[6]                           E.C.’s mother B.C. testified her relationship with the Defendant was abusive for his part - a lot of arguing, tension, some good times but a lot more bad times.  She said he was controlling, manipulating, and yelled a lot.  She said on one occasion he pinned her against the wall.  On another occasion he spanked their son D.M., and one time he grounded E.C. for a week for having a glass of milk before supper, on the basis it would spoil her supper.

 

[7]                           The relationship between B.C. and the Defendant ended shortly after the alleged offence, but they stayed in the home together until September 2013, when the lease ended.  At that time B.C., E.C. and D.M. moved in with B.C.‘s mother, and the Defendant moved to Nova Scotia.

 

[8]                           E.C. did not speak to her mother B.C. about the choking incident with the Defendant until earlier this year, when E.C. was suffering from anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  B.C. took E.C. to the Doctor for medication, then to the psychiatric clinic then numerous trips to a walk-in clinic and a counsellor.  In February 2015 B.C. took E.C. to the RCMP to give a statement, apparently to see if any of the Defendant’s behaviour had been illegal.  According to B.C. that was when she learned for the first time about the incident on which the present charge is based - apparently E.C. had not told her mother, or if she did, it was while the Defendant was present, and it was in the context of the Defendant forcing her to quit one job, without mention of violence - E.C. gave testimony about that but said the Defendant played it off like it was a joke - he generally agreed he did do what E.C. said, kind of laughed and said “yeah she wouldn’t quit her job so I had to do it.”  In his testimony the Defendant denied there was any physical altercation between him and E.C. concerning her employment.

                       

 

Summation by Counsel

 

[9]                           In dealing with the facts on summation, Defence counsel referred to the trial as a “he said, she said” case and noted that the complaint was laid two years after the event.  Counsel noted E.C. said she told her mother shortly after the event, but her mother said she learned of it much later.

 


[10]                       Crown counsel asserted E.C.’s evidence was candid, truthful, and detailed, and in addition to the incident on which the charge is based, he referred to other events in this troubled household, in which the Defendant acted badly.
