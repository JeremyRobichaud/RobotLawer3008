Overview of the Facts

 

[5]                 Sergio Arguello was murdered in his home in the early morning hours of December 9, 2005.  The cause of death was a gun shot to the chest.  Mr. Arguello’s home was also ransacked and set on fire.

 

[6]                 The two witnesses who provide the most direct evidence that is relevant to the question I have to decide are Cody Oystryk and David Cortes. Oystryk was the only witness to provide a narrative of the events surrounding the murder.  Therefore I will deal with his evidence at this point in my reasons.  As only a portion of Cortes’ evidence relates to the murder of Mr. Arguello, and as it relates more to the question of whether the murder is first or second degree, I will set out his evidence at a later point in my reasons.

 

[7]                 Cody Oystryk testified that Sergio Arguello was a drug dealer and often kept quantities of cocaine and money in his house.  Arguello was also security conscious.  His house was kept locked and only people he knew were permitted into it.  He also kept a dog, Costello, who was trained to be aggressive with everyone but a few people.  Oystryk was one of the people who was able to get along with Costello.

 

[8]                 Oystryk worked for Arguello selling drugs.  He referred to himself as a runner.  Oystryk was working as a runner on the evening of December 8, 2005 and the early morning of December 9, 2005.

 

[9]                 In the early hours of December 9, 2005, the accused Avalos telephoned Oystryk and asked him to come and pick him up at the Petro-Canada across the street from the Gateway Motel.  When Oystryk left to pick up Avalos, Arguello was upstairs sleeping.

 

[10]            Oystryk eventually got to the Petro-Canada to pick up Avalos.  Avalos got into the passenger seat of Oystryk’s car.  A second man, who was introduced to Oystryk as Avalos’ friend from Vancouver, got into the rear passenger seat.  The plan was that they were going to return to Arguello’s house to smoke weed.

 

[11]            On the way to Arguello’s home, Oystryk stopped at this mother’s to pick up a key and at various convenience stores to buy rolling papers and small cigars called Pom Poms.  As Oystryk was driving out of the parking lot from the last store, Zuria hit him in the head with a shotgun and said “This is a jack.”  Oystryk understood that “Jack” means a robbery.

 

[12]            Oystryk fought back.  Avalos kept telling him to calm down, this had nothing to do with him.  Zuria was yelling “I can not believe you grabbed my gun”.  Amongst other things, Avalos told Oystryk to go to Arguello’s house.

 

[13]            On the way there, Oystryk was told to stop at a convenience store because “they” remembered that they had to buy duct tape.

 


[14]            When they arrived at Arguello’s house, Oystryk parked the car in the driveway.  Avalos opened the garage door and Zuria and Oystryk walked in to the garage. Avalos closed the door.

 

[15]            Avalos then duct taped Oystryk’s hands behind his back.  Zuria stood and watched.  Oystryk was able to get a good look at the gun and recognized it as a shot gun.  Avalos told him that it had noting to do with him (i.e. Cody);  Arguello had fucked with the wrong person and that Oystryk should stay calm and all would be O.K.

 

[16]            He recalled Zuria asking Avalos if we should pull out the little gun.  Avalos just grunted. He told Oystryk “If you get the dog to do anything, we’ll shoot you.”

 

[17]            Avalos then went into the house and was able to get Costello into the basement. Oystryk was brought into the house and put on the couch.  His feet were put up on a coffee table and duct taped together.  They also put tape over his mouth.

 

[18]            He watched them go upstairs.  He could hear them going through each room. He then heard a big bang, which he thought came from a door, and then heard two voices saying get down on the ground.  He could hear Arguello “freaking out”.  Then there was one big bang from the shotgun.

 

[19]            Shortly afterwards the two men came down the stairs.  Zuria was carrying the shotgun screaming something about murder and “and yelling that–like, as if he had–as if he had to do it or something.  I don’t know, just...” page 639, line 9 and 10.  Zuria was mad because he had to shoot someone and that Zuria made reference to “he” grabbed my gun.

 

[20]            Avalos and Zuria were arguing back and forth, mostly in Spanish, which Oystryk does not understand.  Zuria was upset that he had blood on his pants and shoes.

 

[21]            Oystryk recalled the two of them standing in front of the sliding doors speaking in Spanish.  He could hear Avalos saying sorry, sorry.

 

[22]            Oystryk thought they had been searching upstairs for drugs and money. He watched them search downstairs.

 

[23]            He also remembered Zuria being upset that Arguello had scratched his face.  They discussed what to do about that.  At one point Zuria spoke of cutting off Arguello’s hand.  Then they decided to burn the place down.  They started to prepare to set the house on fire.

 

[24]            They took all the drugs they could find, including the drugs on Oystryk, all the cash they could find, including the cash on Oystryk and any other valuables they could find, including Oystryk’s ring.

 


[25]            They took the duct tape off Oystryk’s mouth. He could not tell them where any other money or drugs were hidden.  He did, however, convince them to let him help them set the downstairs on fire and to let him go.

 

[26]            Once he was free, Oystryk went to his girlfriend’s house.  Shortly afterwards, he was taken into custody by the investigators.

 

[27]            That concludes my summary with respect to the actual murder or killing of the victim Sergio Arguello. I now turn to the legal principles at play at this point in the proceedings.
