[5]                 Mr. Giroux is charged in count #1 with second degree murder and in count #2 with possession of a weapon, a knife, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace;it is the Crown’s position that Mr. Giroux murdered Mr. Paskimin by stabbing him with a knife. In this application, Mr. Giroux asks for severance of counts 3, 4, 5, 6 from the current indictment. The latter counts include three charges of assault with a weapon against his sister-in-law; they are unrelated to the “murder” events  but are alleged to have occurred within three or four hours after the alleged murder. Count #6  charges obstruction of police nearly nine months after the alleged murder events, in circumstances which are unrelated to the those events.

 

[6]                 The prosecutor objects to severance on the grounds that the jury is going to hear about all of the events which occurred in the hours after the alleged murder, and the Crown is entitled to put before the jury the circumstances in which the accused was arrested; therefore, argues the prosecutor, the jury might as well issue verdicts on the other matters as well as on the murder. The prosecutor also contends that the jury should be given credit for being able to both distinguish between the assaults and murder and heed directions that they are not to engage in prohibited reasoning.

 


[7]                 Mr. Giroux’s application is allowed: counts 3, 4, 5 and 6 are severed from counts 1 and 2.

 

[8]                 Special severance rules apply where murder is charged: s. 589 of the Criminal Code. Of the 6 counts which are currently charged, only counts 1 and 2 arise out of the “same transaction”. Parliament’s limitation on the counts which can be joined to a murder charge must be respected.

 

[9]                 In addition to considerations which arise because the main count charges murder, counts 3, 4, 5, and 6 must also be severed by application of general severance principles. The general principles which have been considered here are:

 

  -        because Mr. Giroux is requesting severance, the onus is on him to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he is entitled to severance. In the circumstances, he has met that onus;

 

  -        counts can be severed if they do not have a sufficiently close factual and legal nexus with the main count. Although the events out of which the assault charges were laid occurred relatively close in time to the events out of which the murder charge was laid, there is no factual or legal nexus between those events and the “murder” events;

 

  -        counts can be severed if they will cause general prejudice to the accused. The additional counts point to the accused’s bad character, but are not probative of the murder charge. Their probative value is therefore outweighed by their prejudicial effect;

 

  -        counts can be severed if required to deal fairly with the accused’s intention to testify. In this case, the accused has a settled intention to testify in relation to the assault charges. It would be unfair to deprive him of that opportunity by maintaining the joinder of the charges;

 

  -        counts can be severed if the trial of those counts will lead to undue complexity in the trial. There would be no undue complexity if all the charges were tried;

 

  -        counts can be severed if severance will not result in an unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings. Severance will result in at least two trials; however, that multiplicity is necessary to achieve fairness.
