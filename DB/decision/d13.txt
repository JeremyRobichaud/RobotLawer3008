I would grant leave to appeal all three sentences. I would affirm
the sentence of two years' imprisonment for use of a firearm
contrary to s. 83(1) and dismiss the appeal in respect thereof. I
would, however, allow the appeals from the concurrent 15-year
sentences for rape and kidnapping and vary them to be six years
each, to be served concurrently, but subject, of course, to the
consecutive two years under s. 83(1). In result I propose
sentences totalling eight years' imprisonment.
