V.        The Legislation
[31]           Relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, the YCJA, and the ITOA are attached as an Appendix.

[32]           Section 18 is a deeming provision defining when a sentence imposed on a youth offender by a foreign entity will be treated as an adult sentence. 

[33]           Section 20 is also a “deeming” type provision. It describes whether a transferred offender will serve their sentence in a federal or provincial institution, based on the theoretical nature of what the sentence could have been if the offender had been sentenced in Canada.  Under s. 20(a) an offender will be detained in a provincial correctional facility for adults if the sentence imposed by the foreign entity could have been a youth sentence under the YCJA.  Section 20(b) provides, on the other hand, that an offender will be detained in a penitentiary if the sentence imposed by the foreign entity could have been an adult sentence and their sentence is at least two years.

[34]           Section 21 of the ITOA provides that, subject to s. 20, an offender sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more will be detained in a penitentiary. Mr. Khadr’s sentence was more than two years; it was eight years.  Therefore, unless s. 20 directs otherwise, Mr. Khadr is to be detained in a penitentiary
