Respondent was convicted of sexual assault contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. He entered the home of the complainant, a fifteen‑year‑old girl, without invitation, seized her around the shoulders and arms and grabbed her breasts. When she fought back, he said: "Come on dear, don't hit me, I know you want it." She testified at trial that he tried to grab her "private" but did not succeed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that the modifier "sexual" in the new offence of sexual assault should be taken to refer to parts of the body, particularly the genitalia. Because there was no contact with the complainant's genitals, the conviction at trial was set aside and a conviction for common assault substituted. The only question arising in this appeal is that of the definition of the offence of sexual assault.
