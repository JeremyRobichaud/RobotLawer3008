[80]           There were numerous other details of this nature and quality.  All of these details, and S.N.â€™s testimony about how she felt at the time while experiencing these events, satisfies me beyond a reasonable doubt that S.N. is telling the truth.

[81]           On all of the evidence I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that S.N. was sexually touched by Mr. Navia without her consent.  Mr. Navia intended to touch her sexually and he knew that she had not consented.




[82]           The Crown therefore has proven the elements of sexual assault beyond reasonable doubt.  I find Mr. Navia guilty as charged.

Dated at the City of Calgary, Alberta this 26th day of January, 2021.
