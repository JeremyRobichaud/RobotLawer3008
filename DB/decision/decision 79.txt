[53]            The Crown has not met the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate. I conclude that it may not have been until moments before he struck Quinn that Diebel realized what he was going to do. I have not found that Diebel was in a state of mania or hypomania at the time of the murder, nor have I found that his condition impaired his ability to plan and deliberate. I do agree, however, with the comment of Dr. Duska that he “could not rule out the possibility” that Deibel may have been suffering from mania or hypomania on September 15, 2002. I find that there is not sufficient evidence to permit me to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate.
