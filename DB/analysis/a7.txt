Other cases



[25]         As noted above, essentially the appellant does not quarrel with the enunciation of the law by the trial judge.   Rather, he says that the result was, when compared to other cases, an inappropriate application of the maximum period of ineligibility for parole.




[26]         In Shropshire, Iacobucci J. described the determination of parole ineligibility  as “a very fact-sensitive process.”  This caution must be born in mind when examining the cases presented by the appellant as being comparable: R. v. Butt (1987), 1987 CanLII 5192 (NL SC), 62 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 227 (N.L.T.D.); R. v. McLaren (1989), 1989 ABCA 79 (CanLII), 94 A.R. 317 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Pendergast (C.J.) (2002), 2002 CanLII 54090 (NL SC), 214 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 9 (N.L.T.D.)[6]; R. v. Beamish (D.L.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 3735 (PE SCTD), 144 Nfld & P.E.I.R. 357 (P.E.I.S.C.); R. v. Cousins (J.D.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 19840 (NL SC), 174 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 272 (N.L.T.D.) and R. v. Yaeck (1991), 1991 CanLII 2732 (ON CA), 6 O.R. (3d) 293 (Ont. C.A.).  The period of ineligibility for parole in these cases ranged from 14 years (Butt) to 20 years (Yaeck).  I shall not review them in detail.  Suffice it to say, there are factors which distinguish them from this case.  For example, Butt and McLaren were decided in the 1980s, when the approach to increases beyond 10 years ineligibility was different than it is at present[7]. Pendergast who pleaded guilty to 2nd degree murder shot and killed a woman with whom he had had a relationship.  In Yaeck, as in this case, the victim received multiple knife wounds, though the record of Mr. Yaeck was lengthier than that of Cousins.  In none of these cases, had the offender been involved in another death.



[27]         Even the Cousins decision respecting the Squires murder can be distinguished, as while we are concerned with the same offender, at the time of that murder his circumstances did not include a second conviction of murder.  For the Squires murder Cousins was sentenced to life imprisonment with a period of ineligibility for parole of 18 years.  However, it should be noted that the trial judge in that case added, “in addition to the time served while awaiting trial”. This would indicate that the trial judge saw the period of ineligibility for parole to be longer than 18 years but I am unable, from the decision, to determine precisely what was the time served while awaiting trial. A review of the submissions made during the sentencing hearing for the Squires murder indicates that the additional time would be a minimum of 1 year, up to perhaps a year and a half.



[28]         What the two murders committed by Cousins have in common are a lack of remorse demonstrated by Cousins on either occasion, attempts to mislead the police, murder by stabbing, though in the case of Shaw he received the more violent attack, and no discernable reasons for the crimes.



[29]         Though there are not many cases in this country where the 25 year ineligibility for parole has been imposed I have found one of those cases particularly instructive as to the approach to take.  In R. v. Olsen (1999), 1999 CanLII 1541 (ON CA), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 355 at paragraph 49, Laskin J.A., for the Ontario Court of Appeal, said:



The discretion vested in the trial judge under s. 745.4 recognizes that second degree murders can vary both in seriousness and in moral culpability.  By giving courts discretion to impose a 25-year period of parole ineligibility, Parliament has recognized that some second degree murders are as serious and as morally culpable as a first degree murder.  A frequently cited standard is that the maximum period should be reserved for “the worst offence and the worst offender”.  I find that standard unrealistic in the sense that no matter how repugnant the crime and no matter how repulsive the criminal, the fertile human mind can always conjure up a worse offence and a worse offender.  I prefer to think of a “worst group of offences and a worst group of offenders” for which the maximum period of parole ineligibility may be imposed.




In Olsen, one of the offenders, Podniewiez, was given 25 years ineligibility for parole after being convicted of the second degree murder of his infant daughter whom he shook on several different occasions and for whom he sought no assistance during the several days she was dying.  Podniewiez had previously assaulted another child leaving him severely brain damaged and was on parole at the time of the murder. He showed no remorse and nothing in his background explained or mitigated his conduct.



[30]         In R. v. McInnis (1999), 1999 CanLII 2671 (ON CA), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 515, the victim was stabbed while lying on a beach. The victim seemed to have been chosen at random.  McInnis was given a period of ineligibility for parole of 24 years. The offender had a lengthy criminal record including crimes of violence.  The Ontario Court of Appeal noted at page 538 that “in considering the character of the appellant, it was open to the trial judge to take into consideration that within days of this murder, [McInnis] killed another person in circumstances amounting to manslaughter.”



- The Faint Hope Clause



[31]         Section 745.6 (1) of the Criminal Code (the so called faint hope clause) enables a person, who has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until more than 15 years of the sentence has been served, to apply for a review after 15 years.  Section 745.6(1) does not apply to the appellant because he has been found guilty of committing two murders .  Section 745.6(2) says:



A person who has been convicted of more than one murder may not make an application under subsection (1), whether or not proceedings were commenced in respect of any of the murders before another murder was committed.



The trial judge made note of this fact in his decision.



[32]         The appellant argues that the inapplicability of the faint hope clause should mean a lesser period of ineligibility for parole.   It would be tantamount to undermining the intention of Parliament, if one were to arrive at an appropriate level of punishment and then reduce it because Parliament had decreed that the offender could not take advantage of the faint hope clause.



[33]         Here, the trial judge referred to the factors listed in section 745.4 and considered each of them.   It seems evident that this offence and this offender fall within the “worst group of offences and a worst group of offenders”.  The appropriate range of ineligibility for parole would include up to 25 years.  I see no basis upon which to interfere with  the trial judge’s choice of the maximum period of ineligibility.
