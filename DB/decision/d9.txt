Decision

14                 The accused takes issue with the trial judge’s charge in a number of ways.  First, it is submitted that the trial judge so denigrated the theory of the defence in her charge to the jury and so forcefully stated her own opinion, that the jury’s ability to render an impartial verdict was impacted prejudicially.  Second, it is submitted that the jury was improperly told to use its “common sense” in certain occasions and that the trial judge misstated the evidence on several occasions.  Third, it is submitted that the trial judge erred in permitting a photograph of the deceased’s face taken at autopsy to be admitted into evidence.

15                 With respect to all of those arguments, I find no merit in them.  It is unrealistic to isolate certain sentences or words in a charge.  Rather, in reviewing the charge on appeal, the court is to apply a functional approach and view the charge as a whole.  Not only should the closing charge be reviewed, but where, as in this case, the trial judge gave direction to the jury throughout the trial, the opening charge, those directions throughout the trial, and the closing charge should be reviewed to determine whether the jury could be said to have been led into error.  Our court has recognized this on a number of occasions.  See R. v. Duck (N.J.) and Duck (J.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 14856 (MB CA), 85 Man.R. (2d) 91, R. v. Jack (B.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 15019 (MB CA), 88 Man.R. (2d) 93, and R. v. Laporte (C.R.) (1994), 1994 CanLII 16622 (MB CA), 92 Man.R. (2d) 278.

16                 Similar comments can be found in a number of Supreme Court of Canada decisions, including R. v. Cooper, 1993 CanLII 147 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, where Cory J. observed (at p. 163):

It has been said before but it bears repeating that it would be difficult if not impossible to find a perfect charge.  Directions to the jury need not, as a general rule, be endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and criticism.  Rather the charge must be read as a whole.



17                 More recently, the Supreme Court has gone one step further and articulated a “functional approach” to appellate review of jury instructions.  In R. v. Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, Lamer C.J.C. commented (at para. 32):

… I cannot emphasize enough that the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury.  An accused is entitled to a jury that understands how the evidence relates to the legal issues.  This demands a functional approach to the instructions that were given, not an idealized approach to those instructions that might have been given.



18                 The functional approach in  Jacquard has been cited, with approval, in a number of subsequent appellate decisions and, in particular, by our court in  R. v. Jorgensen (T.J.) (2001), 156 Man.R. (2d) 252, 2001 MBCA 117.

19                 As already stated, not only should the jury charge be considered as a whole, but it should also be considered within the greater context of the trial.  In  Jacquard, Lamer C.J.C. examined a host of factors relating to the greater context of the trial, including how the issue was treated by defence counsel at trial, the address of Crown counsel, and submissions of counsel with respect to the jury charge.

20                 I turn now to a more detailed discussion of the accused’s submissions with respect to the trial judge’s charge.

21                 It is the position of the accused that the court denigrated the theory of the defence in her charge to the jury.  Six examples are put forward.  Many of these examples are quibbles over the language of one sentence or a few words of the charge.  I have already said that a charge is not to be judged by isolating a phrase or a sentence, but rather, the question is whether, read as a whole, it could be said that the jury was misled.

22                 However, the defence also points to instances where it is submitted that the trial judge gave her own opinion and did not state that it was her opinion as opposed to the evidence of witnesses.  It is argued that the effect of this was to denigrate the theory of the defence.

23                 For example, the defence submitted that the accused had no blood on his clothing.  The court pointed out in the charge that he had an opportunity to wash.  Again, the defence submitted that the death was accidental and an unknown individual had come upon the dead body, taken her shorts off, and put the body in the river.  The court asked the jury to consider why someone would take the deceased’s shorts off before putting her into the water.  The court suggested that it would be “difficult” and “it would leave one covered with blood.”  She asked the jury, “Does it make any sense to you?”  She asked the jury to consider why anyone would dispose of a body if death had occurred accidentally.  The court opined that the decision to dispose of the body in these circumstances could not have been “easy” or “clean” or “particularly safe to do so,” as one could lose one’s footing in the loose stones.

24                 The trial judge has a duty to place the theory of the defence before the jury and to refer to the substantial evidence bearing on the defence in a way that will ensure the jury’s due appreciation of the evidence.  See R. v. Yanover and Gerol (1985), 1985 CanLII 3619 (ON CA), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 at 328 (Ont. C.A.).  Where the trial judge deprecates the theory of the defence, this is an error in law requiring the verdict to be set aside and a new trial ordered.  See R. v. Sophonow (No. 1) (1984), 1984 CanLII 3811 (MB CA), 29 Man.R. (2d) 1 at paras. 3-5 (C.A.), aff’d 1984 CanLII 124 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 524.

25                 However, there is a difference between deprecating the defence and offering an opinion.  Highlighting portions of relevant evidence for the jury and suggesting certain questions they might wish to consider is a far cry from such phraseology as “[y]ou have the spectacle of the dead sure witness recalling a visitor” (Sophonow, at para. 16).

26                 Certainly, there are also limits to the expression of an opinion by the trial judge.  The trial judge is entitled to express a view of the evidence so long as:

(1)     the jury understands that they are not bound by the judge’s views on the evidence;

(2)     the opinions are no stronger than the facts warrant; and

(3)     the opinions are not overstated to the point where there is a likelihood that the jury would be over-awed by them.

See R. v. Garofoli (1988), 1988 CanLII 3270 (ON CA), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 132-34 (Ont. C.A.).

27                 In this case, the jury was told they were not bound by the judge’s views on the evidence.  They were told that they were the judges of the facts, not her, and they were told that, although she was entitled to express an opinion, they were not bound by that opinion.  Given the theory of the defence that the victim fell in a way as to cause such damages coupled with the theory that someone came along, found her dead, and dragged her body into the river, the questions raised by the judge are no stronger than the facts warrant.  She has the right, as well as the duty, to highlight relevant pieces of evidence for the jury to consider.  In this case, the charge did not go beyond the appropriate boundaries.

28                 I also do not agree with defence counsel’s submission that the trial judge failed to summarize or explain the expert testimony of Constable Rautavuori and Constable Slemko in relation to the bloodstain evidence or that she should have highlighted for the jury the difference in qualifications and experience of those two experts.

29                 The trial judge charged the jury extensively as to how they should weigh the testimony of expert witnesses.  In her opening directions, she discussed the testimony of witnesses generally.  Then, when Constable Rautavuori was cross-examined as to his qualifications, she explained to the jury the special nature of an expert witness’s testimony.

30                 Finally, in her closing charge, she instructed the jury on how to evaluate the testimony of expert witnesses.  She told them to consider the “education, training and experience of the expert” and how to deal with differences of opinion between the experts.  She linked the relevance of the expert evidence as to bloodstaining at the scene with the issue of “whether this woman was assaulted or whether she may have accidentally fallen to her death.”  While she was not obligated to review each piece of evidence, the trial judge did highlight the matters which she considered especially significant and concluded by reminding the jury that “because of the technical nature of … their testimony, I have obtained transcripts of the testimony of each of them for you, and those are available to you should you wish them.”

31                 It should also be noted that the conflict in opinions and differences in qualifications was drawn to the jury’s attention in the submission of defence counsel.  She urged the jury to review the curriculum vitae of the experts and specifically mentioned that the defence expert designed the course taken by the Crown expert.

32                 This is quite a different situation than the cases cited to us, such as   R. v. Yager, [1998] O.J. No. 3953 (Q.L.) (C.A.), and R. v. Hanscom (D.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 4783 (NB CA), 172 N.B.R. (2d) 29 (C.A.).  In the former case, none of these things were done, and in the latter case, the trial judge did not charge the jury on how to weigh the evidence of experts.

33                 I also reject the suggestion that the trial judge misstated the evidence by telling the jury that certain matters should be decided by the application of their common sense rather than by expert opinion.

34                 Careful distinction must be drawn between telling a jury to use their common sense in deciding whether to accept certain expert evidence and telling them they may use their common sense in coming to technical conclusions on the very issue for which expert opinion is being admitted.  In this charge, the jury members were told to use their common sense often, at least ten times by my count.  While the phrase may have been overused, most of the references were innocuous, such as instructing the jury members to use their common sense when weighing the evidence, including the evidence of the experts.  A reading of the charge reveals that most of the instances refer to situations where the jury was told not to prefer their own common sense over the opinion of the experts, but rather, to use their common sense in determining which of the evidence of the experts to accept, if any.

35                 A jury can and must use its collective wisdom in considering the value of expert evidence.  It must consider the qualifications and impartiality of each expert.  It must also consider whether the assumptions upon which the witness’s opinion is based are supported by the evidence, and it must consider the whole of the opinion itself.  Using one’s common sense is an often-used phrase to explain that process.  For example, in  R. v. Terceira (1998), 1998 CanLII 2174 (ON CA), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 1, aff’d 1999 CanLII 645 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 866, the Ontario Court of Appeal, in examining a trial judge’s charge dealing with DNA evidence stated (at para. 65):

The trial judge should tell them to use their common sense in their assessment of all of the evidence on the DNA issue and determine if it is reliable and valid as a piece of circumstantial evidence.



36                 There are, however, two occasions in which the defence argues that the trial judge instructed the jury to rely on its common sense  rather than the evidence of the experts.  The first occasion involved the trial judge’s summary of evidence given by the pathologists, Dr. MacDonald (for the Crown) and Dr. Ferris (for the defence), regarding the likelihood of the skin being scraped if covered by denim shorts.  The second was the judge’s summary of evidence given by the blood-spatter experts respecting the likelihood of blood being absorbed into a silt ground surface.  The relevant segments of the charge are as follows:

….  Dr. MacDonald does not believe that significant abrasions to the skin would occur through denim and underpants.  And therefore he comes to the conclusion that Ms. Clarke’s blue jeans shorts had to have been removed and the force applied to her hip while she was still alive.  If her shorts were removed from her and the force applied to her while she was still alive, then obviously this is a significant piece of evidence rebutting the suggestion that she may have accidentally caused her own death.  Dr. Ferris on the other hand states that people who fall down while wearing jeans cannot only bruise themselves where they land but they can cause heavy scraping of the skin underneath the jeans.  In that respect, ladies and gentlemen, you may wish to assess the reasonableness of their opinions in light of your common sense and life experience.  If the death of Ms. Clarke was as a result of a fall, an accident, and with bleeding starting two-thirds of the way up the embankment, when did her blue jean shorts get taken off.  Ms. Dunn says perhaps they were removed in the course of someone dragging the body of the deceased down to the river.  You can weigh the reasonableness of that suggestion.

Another area of testimony that may be of significance to you on the issue of whether this woman was assaulted or whether she may have accidentally fallen to her death is the blood staining at the scene.  There is a certain amount of disagreement about the significance of the blood stains between the evidence of Constable Rautavuori and Constable Slemko of the Edmonton Police Service.  Constable Slemko acknowledges that he was not at the scene.  He bases his opinions on photographs of the scene that were taken by Constable Rautavuori some considerable time after the incident.  Again, because of the technical nature of the [sic] their testimony, I have obtained transcripts of the testimony of each of them for you, and those are available to you should you wish them.  I am not going to attempt to summarize their pertinent findings.  One matter that may cause you concern, however, is Constable Slemko’s certainty that wet blood being visible at the top of the pieces of the gravel in the sidewalk but not in the silty material between the gravel necessarily means that these were transfer marks only.  Does your common sense tell you that liquid blood might sink into the silt relatively quickly but would not sink into a stone wall or into the pieces of gravel themselves?  Constable Rautavuori states that when he saw, first saw these locations, what he was seeing was pools of blood.  This is a matter of fact for you to assess.



37                 The jury is entitled to use its common sense to determine issues that do not require expert opinion to resolve one way or the other.  Respecting the denim, the trial judge specifically said that the pathologists were not expert in that area.  She stated:

There is one area of evidence from the autopsy in which both pathologists agree on the medical testimony.  They agree on that which is within their area of expertise in other words, but disagree on something that doesn’t require an M.D. to determine; namely, how tough is blue denim.  I am referring to the area of injury over the left hip of the deceased.



38                 I agree with the trial judge that the strength of blue denim was a matter outside the expertise of  these experts.  Dr. MacDonald is an anatomic pathologist specializing in the study of tissues that have been surgically removed from the body.  Dr. Ferris is a forensic pathologist.  Although he is more experienced in medico-legal analysis of the cause of death, he too had no particular expertise in the strength of materials in relation to impact on skin.  In the absence of properly qualified experts on the point, the jury was entitled to come to its own conclusion on the issue in light of all the evidence.

39                 The same is true of the second comment with respect to the absorption of blood into various ground surfaces as opposed to the expertise of the witnesses on the issue of the geometric patterns created by blood when a source is impacted by a force.

40                 The jury was directed to use common sense in issues which related to the expert opinions, but which were not matters that required expert opinion to resolve one way or the other.

41                 The court permitted the photograph of the deceased’s face taken at autopsy to be admitted into evidence “for the limited purpose for which it has been admitted, to show you in a way that words and drawings could not the extent of the dislocation of the bony features of Ms. Clarke’s face.”

42                 The defence argues that the admission of the photograph was an error in law and that, in this case, the prejudicial impact outweighed the probative value of the evidence.  The prejudice alleged is that, given the graphic nature of the photograph, the jury will disregard court instructions to the contrary, become prejudiced against the accused, and use the evidence for inappropriate purposes.

43                 The following six grounds for admitting photographic evidence in Canada were summarized in R. v. Schaefler, [1993] O.J. No. 71 (Q.L.) (Gen. Div.) (at para. 24):

1)        to illustrate the facts on which experts base their opinion and to illustrate the steps by which they arrive at their opinions;

2)        to illustrate minutiae of objects described in the testimony of a witness, i.e.; to show the nature and the extent of the wounds;

3)        to corroborate testimony and provide a picture of the evidence and to assist [the] jury in determining its accuracy and weight;

4)        to link the injuries of the deceased to the murder weapon;

5)        to provide assistance as to the issues of intent and as to whether the murder was planned and deliberate;

6)                 to help the jury determine the truth of the theories put forth by the crown or defense, e.g.; as to which accused committed the crime; as to whether the crime was committed in self-defence.



44                 The trial judge must weigh the probative value  of the evidence against the prejudice of the accused within the context of the unique factual situation.  It is a decision within the jurisdiction and discretion of the trial judge.  See R. v. Kinkead, [1999] O.J. No. 1498 (Q.L.) (S.C.J.).

45                 At issue in this case was whether the injuries suffered by the deceased were as a result of an accident or were inflicted intentionally, similar to the issue in the Schaefler case, where the photographs were also admitted.  Also, the expert witness Dr. Ferris relied on the photograph in coming to his conclusion, a conclusion which was different from that of the Crown pathologist.  In order to assist the jury in weighing the contradictory evidence of the two expert witnesses, the trial judge decided the jury should have access to the evidence Dr. Ferris considered in arriving at his opinion.

46                 I do not agree with the defence argument that the trial judge did not state the purpose for which the photograph was admitted.  In the midst of discussing the degree of force applied to the deceased’s face, the trial judge repeated to the jury that “[t]hat terrible photograph shows the extent to which her nose and cheekbones were smashed better than any words ever could.”

47                 In coming to her decision, the trial judge stated the test correctly and weighed the probative value of the evidence against the prejudice to the accused within the facts of this case.  In her charge, she told the jury the purpose for which the photograph was to be used and warned them against its improper use.  There is no reason to interfere with the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion in admitting the photograph.

48                 Even though the Crown’s case was circumstantial, there was more than ample evidence to support the jury’s finding of guilt.  However, the area of the charge that deals with a finding of first degree murder requires attention and comment.  The jury found the accused guilty of first degree murder.  As such, they must have found that the accused killed the deceased while committing a sexual assault.  There are two issues that I wish to address on this point.  First, whether the trial judge’s explanation of what constitutes a sexual assault was sufficient and, second, whether the trial judge’s charge on when the sexual assault must occur to constitute first degree murder was appropriate.

49                 After outlining the evidence on both sides of the issue, the trial judge directed the jury to decide whether the deceased’s blue jean shorts had been removed while the deceased was alive.  Then, after first reviewing the evidence, she directed the jury to decide the second question of whether the deceased’s genitals had been cut deliberately or accidentally.

50                 These are the two facts relied upon by the Crown to prove sexual assault in this case.  The trial judge instructed the jury that sexual assault was the application of force to another in the context of sexuality and then told them that if they decided that the deceased’s blue jean shorts had been removed without consent or her genitals deliberately cut by the accused, that would amount to a sexual assault.  She presented that as a conclusion at that point in time, although she did later ask the jury to consider “the whole of the evidence” and to determine whether they were satisfied that the “accused sexually assaulted Ms. Clarke as I have defined that term for you.”

51                 With respect to the issue as to whether the death was caused while committing a sexual assault, she instructed the jury that a charge of first degree murder would still be made out even if the heartbeat of the deceased had in fact ceased by the time the sexual assault took place.  The decision that was necessary for the jury to make was whether the sexual assault and the killing were all part of one continuous sequence of events, forming a single transaction.

52                 With respect to these two related issues, it is useful to reproduce the exact wording of the charge, which is as follows:

If you are satisfied that the accused murdered Ms. Clarke; that is, that at the time he caused her death he meant to cause her death or meant to cause serious bodily harm likely to cause death, the next question is whether the accused is guilty of first degree murder or second degree murder.

Murder is first degree murder if death is caused while committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault.  The phrase “while committing” does not mean that the sexual assault and the death must occur simultaneously.  It is sufficient if the sexual assault and the killing are part of the same transaction.  Where the acts causing death and the acts constituting the sexual assault are all part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction, the charge of first degree murder will be made out even if the heartbeat of the deceased had in fact ceased by the time the sexual assault took place.

Let me define sexual assault for you.  I have already defined assault for you.  Assault is the application of force to another without the consent of that other.   Sexual assault is the application of force to another in the context of sexuality.  Forcing someone to remove their clothing or forcibly removing someone’s clothing and exposing their genitals would amount to sexual assault.  Deliberately cutting someone’s sexual organs with a knife or other sharp object would amount to sexual assault.

In this particular case, what evidence is there that may be considered by you in your analysis of whether first degree murder has been made out:

In the first place, there is the evidence to which I have already made reference, that the blue jean shorts were removed from the deceased while she was still alive.  I am not going to repeat that evidence for you at this time.

In the second place, there is the evidence of a clean cut, an incision, to the opening of the vagina of the deceased.  Dr. MacDonald described that incision to you.  He said it had to be made by a very sharp instrument, a knife, a scalpel.  In his opinion, it could not have occurred accidentally.  Dr. Ferris said it might have been accidental.  I refer you directly to the evidence on each on that point.  It may well be that you consider that Dr. MacDonald actually saw the genital area of Ms. Clarke to be significant in assessing this wound.  He saw the cut.  Also he would know the size of the labia.  He would know whether this woman’s vaginal opening was in fact covered by the labia.  People are not constructed identically.  Dr. Ferris said the cut might have been an abrasion although he did not see it.  He also says that even if it was a cut, it may have been accidental.  It may have been accidentally caused, according to Dr. Ferris, by a sharp object on land or in the water.  You may consider it to be significant that there were no other cuts to the inner thighs or the labia.  If this woman’s body on land or in the water was accidentally in contact with some sharp object that could make such an incision, would you not think it likely that the sharp object would also have cut her in more readily accessible spots around her genitals.  Or would you think that a person could spread the legs of an individual who was dead or almost dead and inflict such a cut with much more precision.  That is a matter of fact for you.

. . . . .

Dr. MacDonald places the time of that incision as being at the point of death or after.  It did not occur before death.  Dr. Ferris places the time of the incision as being after death.  But, if you find that it was inflicted by the accused, even if it was inflicted after death, you must still ask yourself whether it was part of a continuous sequence of events which formed a single transaction.  In that regard, you should consider the short period of time in which all of this occurred.  ….

Consider the whole of the evidence.  Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted Ms. Clarke as I have defined that term for you?  Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that death occurred while the accused was sexually assaulting or attempting to sexually assault Ms. Clarke, in other words that the death and the sexual assault were part of a continuing sequence of events forming a single transaction?  If you are, you will find the accused to be guilty of murder in the first degree.  If you are left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused sexually assaulted Ms. Clarke or as to whether the sexual assault and the murder were part of a continuing sequence of events, you will find the accused to be not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.



53                 Section 231(5) of the Criminal Code (the Code) provides as follows:

(5)      Irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person while committing or attempting to commit an offence under one of the following sections:

.  .  .  .  .

(b)   section 271 (sexual assault);

(c)   section 272 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm);

(d)   section 273 (aggravated sexual assault);

.  .  .  .  .

54                 While assault is defined in the Code (s. 265(1)), sexual assault is not.

55                 Courts have indicated that in determining whether an assault was sexual in nature, the court must consider the totality of the facts and circumstances in each particular case, including the nature of the act, the words spoken, and the accompanying gestures.  An act which is in itself ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by the words and conduct occurring at the time the act is committed.

56                 R. v. Chase, 1987 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, is the leading case on the definition of sexuality for the purposes of defining a sexual assault.  There, McIntyre J., after reviewing the law on the former sections of the  Code and changes brought about by the amendments, concluded (at p. 302):

Sexual assault is an assault … which is committed in circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated.  The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one:  “Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible to a reasonable observer” (Taylor, [(1985), 1985 ABCA 51 (CanLII), 44 C.R. (3d) 263 (Alta. C.A.)],  per Laycraft C.J.A., at p. 269).  The part of the body touched, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct, including threats which may or may not be accompanied by force, will be relevant ….  The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering whether the conduct is sexual.  If the motive of the accused is sexual gratification, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual.  It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the circumstances.



57                 So, for example, in the case of  R. v. V. (K.B.), 1993 CanLII 109 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 857, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the accused’s actions constituted a sexual assault even though punishment was the primary purpose of the actions, and not any sort of sexual gratification.

58                 The true substance of the offence is the violation of the sexual integrity of the victim, and the test to be applied in determining whether there has been such a violation is an objective one.

59                 Some assaults are so obviously, objectively sexual that nothing more need to be known than that the acts took place.  For example, forced intercourse is so obviously a sexual assault that one cannot imagine any circumstances that would deprive them of their sexual character.

60                 In Christine L.M. Boyle, Sexual Assault (Toronto:  Carswell, 1984), the author also recognized that there would be a spectrum of cases, ones in which the acts were so overtly sexual, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to categorize them as anything other than sexual.  She writes (at p. 75):

Whatever the meaning of “sexual,” it seems very likely that the courts will apply an objective test (as with indecency) and not focus on the subjective view of either the accused or the complainant.  It also seems likely that most cases will be unproblematic, involving the touching of genitals or breasts, kissing, any touching accompanied by words relating to sex.



61                 In any case where a jury might reasonably have a doubt regarding the sexual quality of the relevant actions, the trial judge is duty-bound to explain to the jury that it is for them to decide whether they are convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the assault was sexual in nature.  That decision should not normally be taken away from them.  The only class of case where such an  instruction is not necessary is where the allegation includes actions which are very obviously, overtly sexual, such as, but not limited to, cases of intercourse, be it vaginal, oral, or anal.

62                 For example, in the case of R. v. Richer (1993), 1993 CanLII 14676 (AB CA), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 399 (Alta. C.A.), aff’d 1994 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 486,  per Fraser C.J.A., the evidence was that the victim had engaged in both vaginal and anal intercourse with her murderer.  The trial judge instructed that “[i]f there was an assault here, then there isn’t any doubt that it was a sexual assault.”  The defence argued that he had taken this finding away from the jury inappropriately.  Chief Justice Fraser held that the trial judge was correct.  Absent consent, such activities were clearly “sexual assaults.”

63                 In the case before us, the trial judge correctly explained to the jury that they first had to decide whether they were convinced that the accused either removed the blue jean shorts from the deceased while she was still alive or cut the opening of the deceased’s vagina.  She adequately summarized the defence evidence in support of its theory that the blue jeans were removed after death and that the cut to the vagina occurred in the water.

64                 The trial judge, however, took away from the jury the determination of whether the assault was sexual in nature.  Although she defined sexual assault as the application of force to another in the context of sexuality, she instructed them that the removal of someone’s shorts, thereby exposing genitalia, or the deliberate cutting of the vagina was necessarily a sexual assault.

65                 Was this legal error?  This case is too close to that end of the spectrum where there is near legal certainty, to the criminal law standard, that the assault was a sexual assault for this instruction to amount to legal error.  Although this is not a case of forced intercourse as in Richer, forcibly removing someone’s clothing, leaving them naked from the waist down, and/or intentionally cutting their genitals, in the absence of an explanation indicating otherwise, are acts violating the sexual integrity of the person so attacked.  This is especially so given the objective nature of the test and the fact that the desire for sexual gratification is not a necessary element for the finding of sexual assault.  The trial judge committed no error when she told the jury that sexual assault was the application of force to another in the context of sexuality and that either of these two acts in this context, if the jury found them to have occurred, amounted to sexual assault.

66                 In order to constitute first degree murder in this case, the jury must find that death was caused while committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault.  They were specifically instructed that the two acts, i.e. the sexual assault and the death of the deceased, did not need to occur simultaneously.

67                 It is true that in determining whether a sexual assault had occurred, the trial judge referred to the violation of sexual integrity that would occur if someone’s clothing was forcibly removed.  She also referred the jury to the fact that “there is the evidence to which I have already made reference, that the blue jean shorts were removed from the deceased while she was still alive.”

68                 In particular, on this point, she charged the jury as follows:

There is one area of evidence from the autopsy in which both pathologists agree on the medical testimony.  They agree on that which is within their area of expertise in other words, but disagree on something that doesn’t require an M.D. to determine; namely, how tough is blue denim.  I am referring to the area of injury over the left hip of the deceased.  That is the area pointed out by Dr. MacDonald as being where hockey players would give a hip check and for women, the widest part of the hip.  There was at that location on the body of the deceased an area of prominent abrasions and significant deep bruising.  Dr. MacDonald stated that those abrasions were not like the drag marks.  These were unpatterned abrasions.  Both pathologists agreed that Ms. Clarke would have been alive when those unpatterned abrasions with deep bruising occurred.  Dr. MacDonald states that the bruising alone could certainly have occurred while Ms. Clarke had her shorts on.  He pointed to the bruising on her chest underneath her clothes.  But the clothes protected her chest from abrasions on top of the bruising.  Dr. MacDonald does not believe that significant abrasions to the skin would occur through denim and underpants.  And therefore he comes to the conclusion that Ms. Clarke’s blue jeans shorts had to have been removed and the force applied to her hip while she was still alive.  ….  Dr. Ferris on the other hand states that people who fall down while wearing jeans cannot only bruise themselves where they land but they can cause heavy scraping of the skin underneath the jeans.



She then continues later on in her charge, albeit in relation to whether the cause of death was intentional or accidental, to discuss once again the blue jean shorts.  She states as follows:

The Crown points to the testimony of Dr. MacDonald to the fact that she was alive when her blue jean shorts were removed.  The Crown points to the testimony of the harbour patrol to the effect that he has never heard of the Red River taking clothing off bodies.  If Ms. Clarke died as a result of an accidental fall, why would someone take her trousers off her body before putting her into the water?



69                 Again later on, when dealing with the question of first degree murder, she repeats with respect to the blue jean shorts that:

In this particular case, what evidence is there that may be considered by you in your analysis of whether first degree murder has been made out:

In the first place, there is the evidence to which I have already made reference, that the blue jean shorts were removed from the deceased while she was still alive.  I am not going to repeat that evidence for you at this time.



70                 As can be seen, the trial judge referred twice to Dr. MacDonald’s evidence that the abrasions on the left hip would have, in his opinion, occurred when the deceased was still alive and after the removal of her shorts.  If the jury accepted Dr. MacDonald’s evidence, then pursuant to the instructions of the trial judge, they must have concluded that she was sexually assaulted by having her shorts forcibly removed and exposing her private parts.  And, they must have concluded that such sexual assault occurred while she was still alive.  Consequently, there was evidence by which the jury could conclude that the accused murdered Ms Clarke while committing a sexual assault, i.e., removing her blue jean shorts, and therefore, a charge of first degree murder was thereby established.  Such decision would result regardless of any conclusion about the cut to the vagina.

71                 However, the trial judge went further and instructed the jury that a charge of first degree murder would still apply even if the deceased had died by the time the sexual assault took place,  so long as it could be said that the acts causing death and the acts constituting the sexual assault were all part of one single, continuous transaction.

72                 Was the trial judge in error in so instructing the jury?  In order to constitute first degree murder, is it necessary for the jury to find that the deceased was alive when the sexual assault took place and that death occurred later?  Or, is it sufficient, where the act of sexually assaulting the deceased and the act of killing are intertwined, that the charge of first degree murder is made out if the acts causing death and the acts constituting the sexual assault are all part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction?

73                 The jury was addressed twice by the trial judge on this point.  In her closing address, counsel for the defence told the jury the following:

Now, remember what we’re dealing with here is a charge of first degree murder and you have to be satisfied that if there was a sexual assault, the deceased would have to have been alive during that sexual assault or that attempted sexual assault.  That’s important.  That’s why Dr. MacDonald and Dr. Ferris discussed at length this particular injury.  Because if you believe that the injury was of a sexual nature but took place after death, then that changes the nature of this particular offence.



74                 Immediately after concluding her remarks, in the jury’s absence, the trial judge asked for case law in support of the position that if the sexual assault took place after death, the charge of first degree murder could not be made out.  The trial judge took the position that the law was that if the sexual assault and the murder were part of a single transaction, then whether someone was alive or dead at any particular moment during the single transaction was an unnecessary point of distinction.  Defence counsel agreed with the description of the law by the trial judge.  About 30 minutes later, and immediately before Crown counsel began his address to the jury, the trial judge gave the following instruction of law to the jury:

Members of the jury, just before I call on Mr. Bell to address you, there was a matter that was raised in the course of Ms. Dunn’s closing where I think she may unwittingly have misdirected you in an area of law.  And just so that you’re not operating under any mistakes about what the law is, I’m going to correct that right now.  I’ll come back to it again tomorrow when I give you my overall charge.

But it relates to whether or not it is necessary for the deceased to have been alive at the time a sexual assault occurred in order for murder to be first degree murder.  Murder is first degree murder if it occurs while committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault.  The phrase “while committing” does not mean that the sexual assault and the murder have to occur simultaneously.  It is sufficient if the sexual assault and the murder are part of the same transaction.  Where the act causing death and the act constituting the sexual assaults are all part of one continuous sequence of events that form a single transaction, the charge of first degree will be made out even if the heartbeat of the deceased had, in fact, ceased by the time the sexual assault took place.

Okay.  I just say that because there’s a possibility that you may have been misled.  I’m sure Ms. Dunn didn’t intend to mislead, and when I raised this with her, she immediately acknowledged there was a problem and agreed that you – that I should clarify it at this stage, so just so that there’s no mistaking what the law is, I clarify that with you now and I’ll save the rest of my charge for tomorrow.



75                 As promised, she repeated this instruction in her main charge as follows:

Dr. MacDonald places the time of that [vaginal] incision as being at the point of death or after.  It did not occur before death.  Dr. Ferris places the time of the incision as being after death.  But, if you find that it was inflicted by the accused, even if it was inflicted after death, you must still ask yourself whether it was part of a continuous sequence of events which formed a single transaction.  In that regard, you should consider the short period of time in which all of this occurred.  Mr. Apetagon lost sight of the couple and heard the scream from the woman at approximately 4:45 a.m.  The police were at the brewery site by 5:01 a.m.  Before the police arrived at the brewery, Mr. Vandenberghe had pulled his car down onto the walkway, just south of the riverboats, and was shining his headlights up toward the building trying to see what was happening.  Mr. Vandenberghe saw a person running from the direction of the bridge in a northerly direction and Mr. Vandenberghe was back up at the site by the time the police had arrived.  There was a very limited window of opportunity.

Consider the whole of the evidence.  Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted Ms. Clarke as I have defined that term for you?  Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that death occurred while the accused was sexually assaulting or attempting to sexually assault Ms. Clarke, in other words that the death and the sexual assault were part of a continuing sequence of events forming a single transaction?  If you are, you will find the accused to be guilty of murder in the first degree.  If you are left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused sexually assaulted Ms. Clarke or as to whether the sexual assault and the murder were part of a continuing sequence of events, you will find the accused to be not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.



76                 I find that the trial judge’s charge to the jury directing them to determine whether the sexual assault and the murder formed part of a single transaction was correct in all of the circumstances of this particular case.  Indeed, a charge as to what constitutes a “single transaction” must be tailored carefully in each and every case.

77                 The underlying offences listed in s. 231(5) of the  Code all involve the unlawful domination of victims.  The Legislature intended that where an accused exploits this position of power and commits murder in the process of such exploitation, the crime warrants the increased stigma and sentence attached to first degree murder.  See  R. v. Nette (2001), 205 D.L.R. (4th) 613, 2001 SCC 78, at para. 62,  per Arbour J.  I agree that the Legislature envisioned the murder taking place either after or during the commission of the underlying offence.  In terms of sexual assault, if the only sexual indignity were completely separate and occurred after the death of the victim, then the charge would be sexual interference with a dead body and not sexual assault.  However, the section also uses the phrase “while committing.”  Therefore, where the underlying offence and the murder are so inextricably intertwined that they form a single, continuous transaction, the requirements of s. 231(5) will be satisfied.  To say otherwise would involve courts in the macabre exercise of attempting to determine by minutes and seconds when life flowed out of the victim.

78                 The court in R. v. Paré, 1987 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618, rejected such a strict construction of the legislation and adopted an analysis where a continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction could support a conviction for first degree murder.  In that case, the accused murdered a young boy two minutes after indecently assaulting him.  The Supreme Court rejected defence arguments that as the violence causing death and the indecent assault were not simultaneous, the accused could not be convicted of first degree murder.  In rejecting that argument and adopting a more contextual and purposive interpretation, Wilson J. stated (at pp. 631-32):

In my view, the construction that counsel for the respondent would have us place on these words is not one that could reasonably be attributed to Parliament.  The first problem with the exactly simultaneous approach flows from the difficulty in defining the beginning and end of an indecent assault.  In this case, for example, after ejaculation the respondent sat up and put his pants back on.  But for the next two minutes he kept his hand on his victim’s chest.  Was this continued contact part of the assault?  It does not seem to me that important issues of criminal law should be allowed to hinge upon this kind of distinction.  An approach that depends on this kind of distinction should be avoided if possible.

A second difficulty with the exactly simultaneous approach is that it leads to distinctions that are arbitrary and irrational.  In the present case, had the respondent strangled his victim two minutes earlier than he did, his guilt of first degree murder would be beyond dispute.  The exactly simultaneous approach would have us conclude that the two minutes he spent contemplating his next move had the effect of reducing his offence to one of second degree murder.  This would be a strange result.  The crime is no less serious in the latter case than in the former; indeed, if anything, the latter crime is more serious since it involves some element of deliberation.  An interpretation of s. 214(5) [now s. 231(5)] that runs contrary to common sense is not to be adopted if a reasonable alternative is available.

In my view, such an interpretation has been provided by Martin J.A. in Stevens, [(1984), 1984 CanLII 3481 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.)].  As noted above, Martin J.A. suggested that “where the act causing death and the acts constituting the rape, attempted rape, indecent assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as the case may be, all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction” the death was caused “while committing” an offence for the purposes of s. 214(5).  This interpretation eliminates the need to draw artificial lines to separate the commission and the aftermath of an indecent assault.  Further, it eliminates the arbitrariness inherent in the exactly simultaneous approach.  I would, therefore, respectfully adopt Martin J.A.’s single transaction analysis as the proper construction of s. 214(5).



79                 In the case of R. v. Ganton (1992), 1992 CanLII 8246 (SK CA), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 259, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal unanimously held that on its proper application, Paré meant that the Crown need not prove that the sexual assault took place while the victim was still alive.

80                 The accused in that case admitted killing his girlfriend by forcing his fingers down her throat.  He had also sexually abused her, the evidence being that her clothes had been removed from her lower body and a beer bottle had been inserted into her vagina with such force that it penetrated the abdominal wall.  Wakeling J.A., in upholding the conviction for first degree murder, said as follows (at p. 263):

This principle enunciated in Paré, which took away the need to pinpoint the time of death, is entirely subverted by the final instructions given the jury by the trial judge.  The trial judge’s amended direction was no doubt influenced by the contention of appellate counsel that it was not possible to sexually assault a dead person.  As logical as this proposition sounds, it cannot be applied in a case such as this without doing violation to the application of s. 231(5) where death is intertwined with a sexual assault.  It is impossible to apply the eminently reasonable direction provided by Wilson J. if the time of death must be so clearly identified as to show it occurred after the assault and not merely as part of the over-all sequence of events.

….  It was not necessary to prove the precise time of death so as to be able to establish that the sexual assault occurred prior to death, it was only necessary to show that the sexual assault and death were part of a continuous sequence of events.  ….



81                 This issue was also canvassed by the Alberta Court of Appeal in Richer.  In Richer, the accused was charged with first degree murder, the theory of the Crown being that the accused murdered the deceased during the sexual assault.  There was evidence of anal and vaginal intercourse, and much of the pathological evidence went to determining how long before death the anal intercourse had taken place.  The Crown’s theory was that strangulation and non-consensual anal intercourse took place either simultaneously or within 30 minutes of death.  One of the grounds of appeal was that the trial judge had invited the jury to convict even if they found that the sexual assault, if there was one, took place following death.  Chief Justice Fraser, writing for herself and Côté J.A., dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial judge had not misdirected the jury on this point.  She concluded that at trial, the case turned entirely on whether the sexual activity prior to death, in particular, the anal intercourse, was forced and whether, if it was forced, there was a sufficient nexus between the assault and the murder to constitute first degree murder.  Sexual assault after death was never at issue.  The jury charge was premised on the assumption that anal intercourse was either contemporaneous with death or preceded it.  Consequently, looking at the trial and the jury’s charge in context, it could not be said that at any point, the jury was invited to convict, even if they found that the sexual activity took place only after the victim had died.  Accordingly, that defence contention had no merit.

82                 Still, Fraser C.J.A., in obiter, expressed sympathy with the position taken by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in  Ganton.  At p. 393, she noted the possibility that there could be “murder followed by sexual activity with a temporal and causal connection between the two.”  In that case, it could still be first degree murder.  If the temporal and causal connection  was absent, i.e., if it was not considered to be a single, continuous transaction, then the sexual activity would amount to indecent interference with a corpse.  Commenting on Ganton, she said (at p. 394):

This entire debate on whether the precise moment of a victim’s death preceded or followed the precise moment of sexual assault is highly artificial.  This “chicken and egg” approach to which came first, the murder or the sexual assault, obscures the essence of the rationale for Parliament’s decision to classify a murder committed during a sexual assault as first degree.  That rationale does not involve punishing a person for committing two separate crimes in a specific order – first sexual assault, then murder – but rather punishing a person because he has committed both in circumstances in which a temporal and causal connection exists between the two.  What is important is not the order of commission but the linkage between the two crimes.  When the required linkage is found to exist, it is the two crimes – sexual assault and murder – committed together, regardless of the order, which represent the ultimate exploitation of the position of power over a victim and arguably mandate a conviction for first degree murder.



83                 She also noted at p. 397, relevant given the facts in our case, that “the removal of Jasman’s clothes prior to death would, absent her consent, constitute a sexual assault in any event.”

84                 There is jurisprudence to the contrary.  In R. v. Quesnel (1991), 1991 CanLII 11938 (MB CA), 71 Man.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), a case which preceded both Ganton and Richer, Twaddle J.A., speaking for the court, adopted the comments of Wilson J. from Paré in one respect.  He indicated that where a murder was committed after a sexual assault had been completed, it might still be first degree murder if it and the sexual assault formed part of a single transaction.  However, according to his rationale, the reverse was not true.  He stated (at para. 24):

Depending upon the jury’s view of the sequence of events, it is possible, even likely, in the present case that the acts which caused the death preceded the sexual assault.  If that were so, it cannot be said that there was an illegal domination of the victim prior to the acts which caused her death.  There being no underlying sexual assault, the murder cannot be said to be the culminating act of domination.  The single transaction concept in reverse does not, in my opinion, bring the murder within the ambit of s. 231(5) as a “death caused by a person while committing” a sexual assault.  In consequence, a properly instructed jury might reasonably acquit the accused of first degree murder.



85                 In Quesnel, the conviction would have been set aside in any event because, in the court’s view, the trial judge erred in leaving to the jury the option of convicting for first degree murder on the basis of planning and deliberation – all the evidence pointed to an impulsive killing.  Accordingly, the conviction for first degree murder was set aside and a conviction for second degree murder substituted.  Thus, the court’s comments with respect to the point in issue in this case were obiter.

86                 The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Ganton and the Alberta Court of Appeal in Richer did not refer to Quesnel.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal, in the case of  R. v. Williams (1993), 26 B.C.A.C. 30 (application for leave to appeal dismissed (without reasons) December 2, 1993, [1993] S.C.C.A. No. 331 (Q.L.)), distinguished Quesnel without discussion on the basis that in Quesnel, there was doubt about whether the sexual assaults preceded death, whereas in Williams, there was no doubt about the sequence of events.  Quesnel was followed in a subsequent British Columbia Provincial Court case, which adopted it as a correct statement of law and preferred it to Richer.  See R. v. Fliss, [1997] B.C.J. No. 3069 (Q.L.).  In that case, a preliminary inquiry judge committed the accused to trial on both a charge of first degree murder and on a charge of indecent interference with a body.

87                 I do not find these two points of view on the interpretation of s. 231(5) to be necessarily contradictory.

88                 Where sexual activity clearly occurs after death, then a charge of first degree murder cannot be made out.  As stated in Quesnel, at para. 24, “[t]here being no underlying sexual assault, the murder cannot be said to be the culminating act of domination.”  The murder did not occur “while committing” a sexual assault.

89                 Where a sexual assault clearly occurs before death, the issue does not arise.  This would also include a factual situation where the sexual assault was started before death and was merely completed or intensified after death.  Also, pre-death violence perpetrated to subdue a victim for the purpose of perpetrating a sexual assault is in itself a sexual assault.  See, for example, Richer,  per Fraser C.J.A., at p. 394, and Fliss, at para. 39.

90                 This issue arises only in circumstances where the sexual acts are inextricably linked and intertwined with the murder.  In that case, it will be for the jury to determine as a matter of fact whether the temporal and causal connections between the murder and the sexual assault are so close together that they form a continuous single transaction.  If so, then, as a single transaction, the murder occurred “while committing” a sexual assault and a charge of first degree murder is made out within the parameters of s. 231(5).

91                 The continuous transaction concept adopted by the Supreme Court in Paré, and used by the trial judge in her charge, not only fulfills the intention of the Legislature, but eliminates “the difficulty in defining the beginning and end of an indecent assault” (Paré, at p. 631).  It prevents the law from being brought into disrepute by requiring a debate over the precise second of the victim’s death.

92                 This contextual interpretation is supported by the case of  R. v. Russell, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 804, 2001 SCC 53, where the Supreme Court held that a preliminary inquiry judge properly committed the accused for trial on first degree murder by operation of s. 231(5) where the accused was charged with forcibly confining and sexually assaulting one individual immediately prior to murdering an occupant of the same dwelling.  Thus, even though there were two separate victims, it was sufficient if the killing was closely connected, temporally and causally, with an enumerated offence.
