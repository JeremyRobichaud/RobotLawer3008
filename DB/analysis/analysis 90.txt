I agree with the emphasized comment, but would state it slightly differently and in somewhat more emphatic terms.

52     In my view, where a person, with knowledge of a conspiracy (which by definition includes knowledge of the unlawful object sought to be attained), does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy can be inferred. To be precise, it would be evidence of an agreement, whether tacit or express, that the unlawful object should be achieved. Ultimately, that issue is one for the trier of fact, who must decide whether any inference other than agreement can reasonably be drawn on the evidence. But, as I will explain, the case at hand illustrates how a constellation of such facts can make a finding of membership a virtual certainty.

53     In so concluding, I note that conspiracies are often proved by way of circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence of an agreement tends to be a rarity. However, it is commonplace that membership in a conspiracy may be inferred from evidence of conduct that assists the unlawful object. Justice Rinfret made this basic point in Paradis v. The King (1933), 1933 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1934] S.C.R. 165, some eight decades ago:

Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may be established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence. [p. 168]

54     Furthermore, it is not necessary that all members of a conspiracy play, or intend to play, equal roles in the ultimate commission of the unlawful object. Indeed, members in a conspiracy need not personally commit, or intend to commit, the offence which each has agreed should be committed: R. v. Genser (1986), 1986 CanLII 4942 (MB CA), 39 Man. R. (2d) 203 (C.A.), aff’d [1987] 2 S.C.R. 685.2 Any degree of assistance in the furtherance of the unlawful object can lead to a finding of membership as long as agreement to a common plan can be inferred and the requisite mental state has been established.

[81]           All parties acknowledge, under the circumstances of this case, that the Crown must show evidence of a conspiracy to murder Vinh, between two or more of the accused.  Eastgaard, as a police agent, who had no intention to participate in the criminal objective or goal of murdering Vinh, legally cannot agree or be a member of the alleged conspiracy: R. v. O’Brien, 1954 CanLII 42 (SCC), [1954] SCR 666.  Trong, Henry and Balla could not conspire with Eastgaard, as a matter of law.

Case Law – Counselling the Offence of Commit Murder
[82]           Justice Watt set out the governing principles of counselling in R. v. Root, 2008 ONCA 869 at paras. 83 – 84 and 86:

83 Counselling includes but is not limited to procuring, soliciting and inciting.  What is essential is an active inducement or advocacy, not merely the description of the commission of the offence.  R. v. Hamilton, 2005 SCC 47 (CanLII), [2005] 2 S.C.R. 432, at paras. 15, 22 and 23; R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 56.  In other words, the actus reus of counseling requires:  deliberate encouragement or active inducement of the commission of a criminal offence.  Hamilton at para. 29.

84 The mental element or mens rea in counselling “requires nothing less than an accompanying intent or conscious disregard of the substantial and unjustified risk inherent in the counselling” (emphasis removed): Hamilton at para. 29.  Said somewhat differently, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an “accused either intended that the offence counselled be committed, or knowingly counselled the commission of the offence while aware of the unjustified risk that the offence counselled was in fact likely to be committed as a result of the accused’s conduct”: Hamilton at para. 29.

86 The preliminary crime of counselling is complete when the solicitation or incitement occurs, even if the incite rejects the solicitation or merely feigns his or her assent.  Gonzague at p. 508.

Any Evidence Upon Which a Reasonable Jury Properly Instructed Could Return a Verdict of Guilty
[83]           Whether an order of committal or discharge results shall be determined on the whole of the admissible evidence.  As set out by Moldaver J earlier in these Reasons, quoting Rinfret J, “...only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove [conspiracy] by direct evidence.”  There is a combination of direct evidence, including statements captured during the intercepted communications, and circumstantial evidence in this preliminary hearing. 

Conspiracy to Commit Murder
[84]           The Crown’s case is not without weaknesses.  In the evidence there is no direct evidence of conversations amongst Trong, Henry and Balla, if any, and only one instance during Operation Circumvent, where the three are found together – that being at Brewsters on the evening of September 7, 2012.  (Trong and Henry were also seen together on September 9, 2012.)

[85]           The Defence position also had difficulties.  The reliability of Eastgaard’s viva voce evidence and the witness’s credibility was the focus of cross-examination and some of the argument, in particular by Trong.  Much was made of Eastgaard’s criminal past and defence-alleged criminal acts and other alleged “transgressions” during his participation in Operation Circumvent.  Arcuri, para. 30 as per McLaughlin CJ, reproduced in these Reasons at para. 77, prohibits the assessment of credibility or reliability of the preliminary hearing evidence, when determining if sufficient evidence has been led for a committal to stand trial or whether a discharge should be ordered.  This defence submission with respect to the inherent reliability of the evidence, while a valid consideration at trial, is not persuasive in the present hearing.

[86]           The defence position is that there was no conspiracy to murder Vinh, and if there was, the Crown has failed to prove that each accused or some of them were a member of that conspiracy.

Sufficient Evidence that there was a Conspiracy to Murder Vinh – Membership in the Conspiracy

[87]           I find that the Crown has led sufficient evidence that a conspiracy existed, that is: sufficient evidence that there was an agreement between Trong, Henry and Balla to commit the murder of Vinh, on which Trong, Henry and Balla intended to act.  There is sufficient evidence of each accused being a member in the conspiracy.  There is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. 

Trong Nguyen

[88]           If Eastgaard is believed, Trong presented his plan to murder Vinh, including the manner, the date, and the place to Eastgaard on September 7, 2012.  The Crown’s theory and evidence includes the recruitment of Eastgaard as the shooter, whom as a police agent, could not legally be part of a conspiracy to murder.  Surveillance evidence shows Trong driving to the Mountain View Cemetery with Eastgaard, evidence of conduct consistent with the Crown’s theory and Eastgaard’s testimony.

[89]           The evidence in the preliminary hearing is sufficient proof that Trong was a member of the same conspiracy, that is: agreeing with Henry and Balla to act together in pursuit of a mutual criminal objective or common goal to murder Vinh.  On September 8, 2012, statements by Trong (direct evidence), as testified to by Eastgaard, show some evidence that he had approached others, as he had approached Eastgaard, to participate in a murder plot, including Trong’s statement that “Henry was down” with the plan and that Balla would also take over Eastgaard’s role if he had to leave to comply with his curfew.  Trong is seen by police surveillance at the Mountain View Cemetery with three others, later that evening, looking at grave stones. 

[90]           That evidence is bolstered by numerous statements made by Trong during the intercepted communications, in particular on October 3 and October 19, 2012.  Within the statements made by Trong are references to both Henry and Balla suggesting Trong believed they were aware of the plan and the events on September 9, some further evidence implicating Trong of conspiring with others.  The intercepted communications of October 24, 2012 show continued interest by Trong to shoot Vinh.  The evidence tends to show consideration of the strategy required, if an attempt was made, but does not directly refer to the participation of others. 

[91]           As stated in the leading cases and earlier in these Reasons, conspiracy can be established in absence of overt acts.  The crime of conspiracy is completed once an agreement is reached.  While no murder was committed is fortunate for the purported victim, that fact makes the consideration of the direct evidence and the circumstantial evidence, and the drawing of reasonable inferences, by the trier of fact, all the more important and arguable by the parties. 

[92]           Trong’s written submissions, in support of an order for discharge of the conspiracy count states: “where it can be said that there exists only two equally reasonable inferences, one of guilt and one of innocence, the rule will be applied at preliminary inquiry on the basis that the evidence could not legally be “sufficient” to support a conviction at trial.”  In support, counsel for Trong cited Arcuri and R. v. Petraitis, 2005 ONCJ 449 although Petraitis, at para 33 states the Chief Justice did not discuss this in Arcuri.  In contrast is the following statement of Watt J in Republic of Italy v. Caruna, 2004 OJ No 5851, para. 153: 

If the inferences required are within the field of inferences available on the whole of the evidence, nothing else matters.

[93]           I am not persuaded that this defence submission is applicable to the present case, considering the whole of the preliminary hearing evidence admissible against Trong. 

The traditional rule is that the preliminary hearing is not the proper forum for weighing competing inferences or for selecting from them.  Any doubt as to inferences to be drawn from the evidence must be resolved at this stage in the Crown’s favour. (citations omitted) :  Petraitis, para. 28

Henry Nguyen
[94]           As stated above, the evidence in the preliminary hearing is sufficient proof establishing the existence of a conspiracy.  The evidence implicating Henry as a member of the conspiracy that is: agreeing with Trong, (and arguably Balla) to act with him in pursuit of a mutual criminal objective or common goal to murder Vinh is from Henry’s intercepted communications and his presence in the vehicle with Trong – some evidence of conduct - on September 9, 2012.  There are statements made by Henry, that arguably show Henry had knowledge of the existence of the scheme and that he had an agreement with Trong.  I also note some of the evidence implicating Henry as being a member of the conspiracy with Trong is his intercepted statement - “that I didn’t agree with” that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning Henry did not agree with a portion of the amended plan – Balla assuming the role of a shooter or involved in the actual act of murder, or being in the same vehicle as Henry, when Eastgaard failed to show.

[95]           Henry was a passenger in the Toyota Camry with Trong, when it was driven into the Hunterhorn Plaza, parked and abandoned, on September 9, 2012.  Being with Trong, who according to Eastgaard was planning to murder Vinh, on the date of the planned assassination, also provides circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy could be inferred. 

Byran Balla
[96]           The evidence implicating Balla as a member of the conspiracy that is: agreeing with both Trong and Henry to act together in pursuit of a mutual criminal objective or common goal to murder Vinh is from Balla’s intercepted communications. 

[97]           During the intercepted communication of November 3, 2012, Balla spoke about sitting in a vehicle in the cemetery, on the day of the planned shooting, and that it was he who uncovered the heavy police presence at the site.  He made statements that could reasonably be interpreted to show that he and others were in a vehicle at the cemetery, or with the cemetery in sight, but they were not approached by the police.

[98]           Balla made statements that suggested he was actively acting in the role of surveillance on the day the group planned to shoot Vinh, if and when Vinh made an appearance at the cemetery.  He made statements that arguably directly showed or could show by inference knowledge of the conspiracy and also made statements that showed membership and involvement in the conspiracy as he acted with others for the purpose of executing the planned murder of Vinh.  The statements he made also tend to show his actions were with the knowledge and consent of the Trong. 

[99]           Balla spoke about “the vehicle”, presumably the vehicle Trong and Henry were seen driving and parking at the Hunterhorn Plaza on the day the three allegedly planned to shoot Vinh.  He appeared to have knowledge of the police seizure of the vehicle.

[100]      The whole of the statements of Balla to Eastgaard on November 3, 2012 are arguably his admission of involvement in the conspiracy and bolstered by the circumstantial evidence - membership in the conspiracy to murder Vinh could be reasonably inferred by the trier of fact.  There is evidence of knowledge and conduct.

[101]      Balla cited the case of R. v. Munoz (2006), 2006 CanLII 3269 (ON SC), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 70 (OSCJ) as authority for the proposition that an order of committal was inappropriate for him as any inference drawn that he was a member of the conspiracy to commit the murder of Vinh was based on mere speculation, and was not reasonable on the whole of the evidence in the preliminary hearing.  While that proposition from Munoz, is a widely accepted statement of the law, my assessment of the reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence and the whole of the evidence, including the direct evidence, results in an order of committal to stand trial.  An inference of conspiracy and conspiracy membership may be reasonable on the whole of the evidence – direct and circumstantial.

[102]      In the case put forward by the Crown in the preliminary hearing, as against all three accused, there is evidence of motive, knowledge of the unlawful act, conduct and other statements consistent with an agreement amongst the accused including membership.  I am cognizant that the facts are being disputed by all three accused.  At trial, after an assessment of credibility and reliability of all of the evidence, including the testimony of Eastgaard, and the intercepted communications of the three accused, and the evidence that may tend to assist in the defence of the three accused, the findings of fact are for the trier of fact, who must make findings of fact on the direct evidence and must decide whether on the circumstantial evidence, any inference other than agreement and membership can reasonably be drawn.  As stated by McLaughlin CJC in Arcuri, the preliminary hearing judge does not draw inferences from the facts, or make findings of fact beyond the survey of the evidence led in the preliminary hearing, but does assess whether the elements of the offence may reasonably be inferred from the circumstantial evidence.

Counselling Murder

[103]      Considering the whole of the evidence, the case law referred to earlier with respect to counselling (Root) and the test for committal; there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty:  Shephard.  Where the Crown adduces direct evidence on all the elements of the offence, the case must proceed to trial:  Arcuri.  There is evidence in the hearing that Trong initiated the conversation and actively induced and advocated for the participation Eastgaard in Trong’s plan to murder Vinh.  As stated earlier in these Reasons, there is evidence, if believed, that Trong presented the plan to murder, the manner, the date, and the place to Eastgaard on September 7, 2012.  The fact that Eastgaard had no intention of participating in the murder has no bearing on this issue.
