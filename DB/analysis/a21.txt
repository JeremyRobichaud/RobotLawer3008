Mr. Watson with his usual fairness states that he has no reason to disbelieve the facts related by the appellant. He readily concedes that the appellant had nothing to do whatever with the robbery itself.

[7]                           The appellant has not been a model citizen in the past. A record of twelve prior convictions for related property offences goes back to 1977 and amply supported the sentence imposed by the trial judge without the facts related to us. In the last few years, however, the appellant has made a very real effort to re-establish himself as a useful member of society. He has become a good and reliable worker and employment awaits him upon his release on a term of nine months which he is now serving for breaking and entering and stealing a bicycle. He advises us that while he entered a plea of guilty to that offence, he vas intoxicated when the offence was committed and does not recall it at all.

[8]                           The accused has invited us to impose the constraints of a suspended sentence which he states will support him in his efforts at rehabilitation.
