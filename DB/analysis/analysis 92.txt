IV.      Discussion

 

[11]           The general rule is that all relevant evidence is admissible. Relevant evidence is defined as evidence that tends to “increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” (R. v. Arp, 1998 CanLII 769 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339 at para. 38). The exception to this general rule is that evidence of bad character, or evidence of misconduct beyond that which is alleged in the indictment, is inadmissible. This is because the trier of fact should not consider a person’s character or proven propensity as evidence that the person is more likely to have committed the crime for which he is charged (R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56 (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908 at para. 31). While this type of evidence may be seen as relevant, in most cases its potential prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value (Arp at para. 40 and Handy at para. 54).

 

[12]           The Accused’s Jaguar was damaged by the three individuals on February 24, 2003. They attacked the Jaguar with baseball bats, smashing the windows and otherwise causing extensive damage. Both Tyler Sanjad and another individual admitted in evidence participating in the extensive vandalism. It was two days after the Jaguar was damaged that Raed Sanjad was shot and killed and Tyler Sanjad was shot and injured.

 

[13]           The Crown argues that the Accused’s behaviour at Sovereign sheds light on his attitude towards individuals who might damage his vehicle. The Crown suggests that the incident establishes the Accused’s mental state, being anger at anyone damaging his car, and his motive for committing the offences for which he is now charged.

 

[14]           Character evidence that “shows only that the accused is the type of person likely to have committed the offence in question is inadmissible” (R. v. S.G.G., 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716 at para. 63). Evidence of an accused’s prior misconduct may be admitted into evidence where relevant to a fact in issue. It must be “directly relevant to a key element of the Crown’s theory of the case, such as motive, opportunity or means . . .” (R. v. S.G.G., [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716 at para. 64). However, the Crown must satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that the probative value of the evidence in relation to the particular issue outweighs its potential prejudicial effect (Handy at para. 55).

 

[15]           In this case, the Accused said something like “[he] would get even” with anyone who touched his car. The Crown argues that this is probative of motive and animus. While the comment demonstrates the Accused’s attachment to his vehicle, it is not probative of a motive to kill. The Accused’s comments may indicate his propensity to become angry with anyone who interferes with his use and enjoyment of his vehicle, but “getting even” may mean nothing more than interfering with the use and enjoyment of the vehicle of someone who has done that to him. It is not evidence that the Accused entertained homicidal urges towards the person involved that would lead him to murder that person.

 


[16]           The incident involving Mr. Graham occurred three days prior to the day on which the Accused’s Jaguar was damaged and five days before the shooting. There is no evidence of continuing animus by the Accused towards the deceased between the date the Jaguar was damaged and the date of the offences. It is not even clear that he had knowledge of the involvement of the deceased in the destruction of the Jaguar.

 

[17]           Further, the evidence only shows the Accused’s behaviour towards someone wholly unrelated to the events with which he was later charged. As I have indicated before, his stated intention to get even with anyone who touched his car could simply have been a threat to damage that person’s vehicle. Even if the Accused’s comment could be considered a personal threat, it was not uttered to anyone connected with the murder or anyone associated with the car lot where the murder and attempted murder were committed. Unlike cases where evidence of prior discreditable conduct has been admitted, the actions and comments of the Accused here do not, in any way, show a motive to murder anyone, let alone someone wholly unrelated to the dispute he seemed to be involved in with the repair shop.

 

[18]           Mr. Graham indicated that the Accused seemed occupied with other issues that day, further supporting the view that the Accused’s behaviour at Mr. Graham’s shop cannot positively be connected to the later murder and attempted murder. There is no causal connection established and the temporal one is tenuous at best. The incident simply cannot be seen as part of the narrative leading to the ultimate crimes.

 

[19]           To allow the evidence to be admitted as probative of a motive to commit murder would give credibility to a meaning that may never have been intended. It is of marginal probative value at best, which is greatly outweighed by its potential prejudicial effect. Its admission into evidence would be unfair to the Accused.
