Community Services with respect to the disclosure of information in circumstances applicable to the present case."

          In my opinion, it is reasonable to require Crown counsel, being the representative of the Attorney General, a signatory to the protocol, to make timely inquiries of those responsible in the Ministry of Health and Community Services for disclosure of evidence relevant to the charge against the accused. In this case, counsel failed to do that. The stay was an appropriate order.

          I would dismiss the appeal.
