[11]           The general rule is that all relevant evidence is admissible. Relevant evidence is defined as evidence that tends to “increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” (R. v. Arp, 1998 CanLII 769 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339 at para. 38). The exception to this general rule is that evidence of bad character, or evidence of misconduct beyond that which is alleged in the indictment, is inadmissible. This is because the trier of fact should not consider a person’s character or proven propensity as evidence that the person is more likely to have committed the crime for which he is charged (R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56 (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908 at para. 31). While this type of evidence may be seen as relevant, in most cases its potential prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value (Arp at para. 40 and Handy at para. 54).

 


[14]           Character evidence that “shows only that the accused is the type of person likely to have committed the offence in question is inadmissible” (R. v. S.G.G., 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716 at para. 63). Evidence of an accused’s prior misconduct may be admitted into evidence where relevant to a fact in issue. It must be “directly relevant to a key element of the Crown’s theory of the case, such as motive, opportunity or means . . .” (R. v. S.G.G., [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716 at para. 64). However, the Crown must satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that the probative value of the evidence in relation to the particular issue outweighs its potential prejudicial effect (Handy at para. 55).
