Correlatively, the trial judge did not err in law or in fact in acquitting the appellant.  Accordingly, in accordance with s. 839(1) of the Criminal Code, the application for leave
to appeal and the appeal should be allowed. The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge should be set aside and the decision of the trial judge reinstated and affirmed.
