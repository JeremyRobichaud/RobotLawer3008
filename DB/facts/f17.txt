These are the facts grounding the charge.

[3]        On January 16, 2013, Kevin Maurice and Brian Lee were working at an off-sale establishment in Fort Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan.  At approximately 8:05 p.m., the appellant and Jesse Ray entered the store.  They selected a bottle of Wiser’s whiskey and some cigarettes and attempted to pay for them at the counter with a debit card.  After several unsuccessful attempts to get the debit card to work, the appellant grabbed the bottle of whiskey and ran out the door, closely followed by Mr. Ray.  Brian Lee followed the men out the door and chased after them.

[4]        After about 100 metres of pursuit, the appellant turned around, pulled a knife from his pocket and confronted Mr. Lee.  The appellant swung the knife at Mr. Lee from a distance of about 1.5 metres.  Mr. Lee testified he believed this was just a warning as the appellant was not close enough to strike him with the knife.  The appellant then verbally threatened Mr. Lee.  Mr. Lee recalled the threat when he testified, “And then he told me even if you still are chasing me I will hurt you, so I answer to him, okay, you go.”  The police were then called by Mr. Maurice.

[5]        Three officers immediately attended the scene.  Within a short time, the police found the appellant and the co-accused running from the scene and arrested them after a brief struggle.  A bottle of whiskey and a knife were found near the appellant when he was arrested.  At trial, Mr. Lee identified the knife as being the one used by the appellant to threaten him.

[6]        Shortly after being arrested, the appellant provided the police with a warned statement where he admitted, among other things, that he had:  i) stolen the bottle of whiskey; ii) run out of the store with the whiskey; iii) had a knife when he threatened Mr. Lee; and, iv) dropped the knife when the police caught him.

[7]        The appellant was represented at trial and there his counsel argued the theft and the threat were two separate events.  He cited no authority for this proposition.  The trial judge found the theft and the threat was, in her mind, “without any doubt one continuous event” and the threat was made to enable the appellant to encourage the pursuer to discontinue the chase and to enable the appellant to maintain possession of the stolen goods.  The trial judge found the threat was to overcome resistance to the theft and thus the charge of robbery was made out.

[8]        This Court, on its own initiative, asked the parties to be prepared to argue the issue as to whether or not, in these circumstances, the theft and the threat were in fact two separate events.  If so, the conviction of robbery would be set aside and a conviction of theft would be entered and a fit sentence for that conviction would be imposed.

[9]        After considering the matter, we were all of the view the robbery conviction could not stand, but the included offence of theft was proven.  We issued a brief fiat allowing the conviction appeal, setting aside the robbery conviction and substituting instead a conviction of theft under $5,000.  It followed, in our view, a fit sentence was one of time served in addition to the credited remand time.  We indicated more extensive written reasons would follow and these are the reasons.

[10]   The appellant was convicted of robbery on April 25, 2013.  The trial judge found the testimony of Mr. Lee to be credible. She found the appellant’s swinging of the knife at Mr. Lee constituted a threat to stab.  As stated, she found the theft and the threat to stab were one continuous event and thus constituted a robbery under the Criminal Code.

[11]   The appellant was sentenced to 36 months imprisonment minus five months credit for remand credit.  The trial judge considered the appellant’s lengthy record and the fact that the robbery involved a small business as aggravating factors.

[12]   The Crown argued the authorities, to be discussed below, which held that a robbery as defined in s. 343(a) of the Criminal Code cannot be committed if the violence or threats of violence occur after the offence of theft is “complete” were wrongly decided as being based on obiter comments made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Downer (1977), 1978 CanLII 2340 (ON CA), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 532, a decision on an appeal of a charge of robbery under what is now s. 343(b) of the Code.



[13]   The robbery section reads as follows:

343. Every one commits robbery who



(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property;

(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person;

(c) assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or

(d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.

[14]   The theft section reads as follows:

322. (1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent,



(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;



(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;



(c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or



(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.



[15]   It must be clearly stated the Crown proceeded on the basis the charge against the accused was pursuant to s. 343(a).

[16]   The Crown argues the finding by the trial judge the theft and the threat were one continuous event was not an unreasonable finding and ought not to be overturned.

[17]   The Crown’s essential position is that the theft continued from the taking of the liquor to the threat which was made to overcome resistance to stealing.
