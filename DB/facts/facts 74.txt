Facts

[10]                     The accused abandoned his university studies and joined a criminal organization operated by Derrick Bennett (a.k.a. Fenali).  The accused made deliveries of cocaine from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to the northern community of The Pas, Manitoba.  On one occasion, he was caught by police and a shipment of cocaine was seized.  As a result, the accused acquired a large drug debt to the criminal organization.

[11]                     Over the course of the following year, the accused unsuccessfully attempted to pay off the drug debt by continuing to traffic in cocaine.  In time, the criminal organization began to pressure him for full repayment of the debt.  He turned to friends and family for advice.  They told him to go to the police.  Unwisely, he ignored their counsel.

[12]                     As the months went by, the threats regarding the debt escalated.  Approximately a month prior to the murder of Ms Tran, members of the criminal organization shot at the accused and beat him up, resulting in several broken bones.  Nevertheless, he did not turn to the police for help.

[13]                     In the week before the murder of Ms Tran, the accused received a new threat in the form of a text message from Fenali containing the addresses of his brother and aunt.  The accused had no idea how the criminal organization could have found out where his family members lived.  He took the text message to be an implicit threat that, if the debt was not paid, he would not be the only one killed.  In spite of this ominous development, remarkably, he decided not to contact police, nor did he warn his family members of the threat.  The option he chose in an effort to extricate himself from his predicament was to kill Ms Tran.

[14]                     The accused was asked by police why he didn’t seek their assistance instead of killing Ms Tran.  He told them that he was “scared” and it “would make things much worse if [he] went to police obviously.”

[15]                     The jury heard conflicting versions of the murder plot.  The accused told police that Fenali ordered him to commit the murder in exchange for forgiveness of the debt.  In contrast, the accused’s friend, Tremaine Sam-Kelly, testified that the accused told him that the murder was in essence directed by Ms Tran’s boyfriend, Drake Moslenko, who was a friend of both Fenali and the accused.  Apparently, Moslenko revealed to the accused that Ms Tran was a police informant.  Moslenko proposed a scheme that, if the accused murdered Ms Tran, the two would split her property thus giving the accused a way to repay his debt.  The accused told Sam-Kelly that he decided to kill Ms Tran as a “favour” to Moslenko.  Neither Fenali nor Moslenko testified at the trial.

[16]                     The accused learned, in some way, that every morning at around 7 a.m., Ms Tran would leave her Winnipeg apartment and get into her car to drive to work.  He decided that he would kill her in the parking lot of her apartment building.

[17]                     On the morning of June 19, 2012, he made his first attempt.  He and Sam-Kelly (who was present apparently only for moral support) arrived at the parking lot at around 7 a.m.  Ms Tran’s car was there, as she had not yet left for work.  The accused had with him a murder kit consisting of a backpack which contained: gloves, a knife, a change of clothes and a bandana.  He found a suitable place nearby to change.  However, when he returned to the parking lot a few minutes later, she had already left for work.

[18]                     The next day the accused made a concerted effort to arrive with Sam-Kelly earlier than the day before.  Sam-Kelly testified that, before travelling to the parking lot, he had consumed the drug MDMA, a psychoactive drug that can produce such effects as euphoria, reduction of inhibitions, poor judgment, impulsiveness, decreased co-ordination, altered perception and aggression.

[19]                     Sam-Kelly testified that he was “really affected” by the MDMA and was “flying” at the time of the homicide.  He also gave evidence that the accused had taken some MDMA before killing Ms Tran, although he could not say how much.  He told the jury that the accused seemed “affected” by the drug, but he could not give any opinion as to the degree of the accused’s intoxication.  In his statement to police, the accused said nothing about how much MDMA he may have used before the homicide, nor did he say anything about being intoxicated in any way.  He did not testify at the trial.  The jury was shown surveillance video of shortly before and after the homicide allowing it to observe the accused’s behaviour.  Several witnesses also testified as to normal physical functions the accused could perform before, during and after the homicide.

[20]                     After the accused arrived at the parking lot, he again briefly left the area to change.  He then returned in his change of clothes, with his face covered with a bandana.  He waited for, and then attacked Ms Tran as she was leaving her apartment to go to her car.  After stabbing her 30 times, he fled.  He ultimately stopped, changed and disposed of the contents of his murder kit in a river.  Nevertheless, police located the discarded items.

[21]                     Later, the accused told Sam-Kelly that the murder had not wiped out his drug debt.  The two men discussed various legal and illegal ways of raising funds to pay the debt.  In his statement to police the accused advised that, between the day of the murder and his arrest on June 26, 2012, he had met with Moslenko.  He said that the purpose of that meeting was to ask Moslenko for a loan to make a payment on the debt.
