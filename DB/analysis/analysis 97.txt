III.      Executive Summary of Positions and Decision
[8]               Mr. Khadr argued that an adult sentence of eight years could not have been imposed in Canada for these serious offences, given the mandatory minimum sentences under the Criminal Code.  Therefore, he argued, the only reasonable inference is that the eight year sentence could only be for a youth sentence and he should have been detained in a provincial institution.

[9]               The Respondent, Canada, representing itself and Ms. Hartle, agreed that Mr. Khadr is serving a youth sentence for murder, but also an adult sentence for the four other offences because s. 18(b) of the ITOA provides that a Canadian offender is deemed to be serving an adult sentence if their sentence is longer than the maximum youth sentence under the YCJA.  Further, Canada argued that under s. 743.5 of the Criminal Code, a person destined to serve both a sentence under the YCJA and the Criminal Code is deemed to be serving a sentence under the Criminal Code – in this case a penitentiary sentence.

[10]           Alberta, also named as a Respondent, took no position other than to file the affidavit of Leonard Goueffic, which set out how a transfer inmate would fit within the provincial correctional system, and what facilities and resources would be available to him. I note in passing, as argued by Canada, that under s. 9 of the ITOA, if the transferee was transferred to a provincial institution, the transferring province’s  consent to the transfer would have been required.

[11]           The application for habeas corpus is denied. The result will be that Mr. Khadr will remain in the Federal penitentiary system.  If I had granted the application, I would have then, in accordance with the positions of Counsel, ordered Mr. Khadr transferred to a Provincial correctional facility for adults to complete his sentence.

IV.      Facts
A.        Stipulated facts
[12]           Under the Plea Agreement, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Fact (filed with the materials).  I provide the following brief summary of those agreed facts for context and historical information, noting that these facts have limited relevance to the technical interpretation of the legislation governing the appropriate placement of this transferred offender.

[13]           Mr. Khadr admitted he was not a member of regular armed forces, including a militia or volunteer corps. He further stipulated to a number of facts about the al Queda organization generally and to the involvement of his family in al Queda. He stipulated to visiting al Queda training camps with his father and to receiving al Queda training.  He further admitted to assisting an al Queda cell in planting IEDs and to spying on US forces in Afghanistan. 

[14]           Mr. Khadr also admitted to the charged murder and attempted murder counts that occurred during a battle at a compound in Ayub Kheil in June 2002, when he was 15.  He was injured by shrapnel during bombing of the compound.  Once US forces believed the firefight to be over, they began clearing out the compound.  Mr. Khadr stipulated to the fact that he hid behind a crumbling wall and intentionally armed and threw a grenade at the soldiers.  The grenade fatally injured one soldier and injured another. Another soldier responded and shot Mr. Khadr twice in the torso. 

B.        The Next Ten Years
[15]           In October 2002, Mr. Khadr was transferred to GTMO.  In February 2007, he was charged with:

a.         murder in violation of the law of war;

b.         attempted murder in violation of the law of war;

c.         providing material support for terrorism;

d.         conspiracy; and

e.         spying. 

[16]           Three and a half years later, on October 13, 2010, he agreed to plead guilty in exchange for assurances that the Convening Authority would not approve a sentence greater than eight years and that it would take all appropriate steps to facilitate his transfer to Canada after one year.  The terms of the Plea Agreement provided:

As consideration for my offer to plead guilty set forth above:

a.         The Convening Authority will not approve a sentence of confinement of greater than eight (8) years.

[17]           On October 25, 2010, eight years after his initial detention, Mr. Khadr pleaded guilty to the charges before a Military Commission, composed of seven military officers and presided over by a Military Judge.  Mr. Khadr's guilty plea was accepted and a sentencing hearing was held. While Mr. Khadr was advised that no more than eight years confinement would be approved by the Convening Authority, the members of the Commission were not told of the Plea Agreement for an eight years maximum sentence. On October 31, 2010, the Commission sentenced Mr. Khadr to a global sentence of 40 years confinement, unallocated among the five charges, with no indication of concurrent or consecutive sentences among the charges. 

[18]           On May 26, 2010 the Convening Authority accepted the guilty pleas and sentenced Mr. Khadr to a global sentence of eight years.  

[19]           Gary D. Solis, an expert for Mr. Khadr, swore in his affidavit in this matter that neither the American Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), nor Guantanamo’s Manual for Military Commissions, 2010 (Manual) employ concurrent or consecutive sentencing. I also note that the Manual prohibited granting any credit for pre-trial detention.

[20]           As noted, the Convening Authority accepted only eight of the 40 years of confinement. The “Action” of the Convening Authority reads:

In the military commission of Omar Khadr, only so much of the sentence as provides for eight years confinement is approved, and will be executed.  The accused will be confined in such place as may be prescribed by the Commander, Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or superior authority.

[21]           Mr. Khadr was informed of the Minister’s decision by a letter dated September 28, 2012 from the Minister’s designate, Ms. Lee Redpath, Acting Director, Institutional Reintegration Operations Division, Offender Programs and Reintegration Branch, CSC. The letter set out how  Mr. Khadr’s sentence would be administered under Canadian law and set out the Canadian equivalent offences. It noted that he would be deemed to have been sentenced by a Canadian court to a  “sentence of imprisonment of eight years commencing October 31, 2010 and ending October 30, 2018” and that his statutory release would be calculated in accordance with s. 26 of the ITOA.

[22]           The Canadian equivalent offences, as must be identified by s. 15 of the ITOA, were described in the September 28, 2012 letter as:

- First Degree Murder, contrary to s. 231(6.01) of the Criminal Code;

- Attempted Murder, contrary to ss. 239 and 81(1)(a) or (b) of the Criminal Code;

- Participation in Activities of a Terrorist Group, contrary to ss. 83.18 and 83.2 of the Criminal Code; and

- Spying for the enemy, contrary to s. 78 of the National Defence Act, RSC 1985, c N-5.

[23]           The September 28, 2012 letter went on to provide:

Pursuant to the [ITOA] and the [CCRA], upon transfer to Canada, you will be deemed to have been sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction in Canada to a sentence of imprisonment of eight (8) years…(Emphasis added)

Later it stated:

            Section 29 of the [ITOA] specifies that subject to other provisions of the [ITOA], a Canadian offender transferred to Canada is subject to the [CCRA], the Prisons and Reformatories Act, [RSC 1985, c P-20] and the [YCJA] as if the offender had been convicted and the sentence imposed by a court in Canada.

And still later:

Under Section 4 of the [ITOA], the finding of guilt and sentence imposed in the United States will, upon transfer be deemed to be a finding of guilt and sentence imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in Canada.

[24]           Almost two years after the Convening Authority’s sentence, on September 29, 2012, Mr. Khadr was transferred to Canada under the ITOA to serve the remainder of his sentence.  According to the CSC reports, it is administering the sentence as an eight year sentence.

[25]           The documents evidencing the acceptance of his transfer are in a Memorandum of the Minister of Public Safety’s decision dated September 28, 2012 and two earlier Diplomatic Notes (one from each country) dated, October 23, 2010.[1]  Canada, relying on the Memorandum of the Minister’s decision, noted in its argument,  that the Minister’s decision to transfer considered public safety, and concluded that Mr. Khadr’s sentence “could be appropriately administered in Canada by the CSC and the National Parole Board and agreed to approve his transfer”.  The Diplomatic Notes, in identical language, each recognized that Mr. Khadr would be “subject to Canadian law pertaining to detention and in Mr. Khadr being able to apply to the National Parole Board (an independent tribunal operation autonomously from the Government of Canada) for parole following the completion of one-third of his sentence”.  However, none of this is relevant to the determining the appropriate placement.

[26]           On September 28, 2012, Canada agreed to accept Mr. Khadr’s transfer, and preparatory to his transfer, the Canadian authorities (the Minister of Public Safety, by statute, but designated to the Director, Institutional Reintegration Operations, as permitted by s. 6(2) of the ITOA), applied the ITOA by:

1.         establishing dual criminality;

2.         determining whether the sentence from the United States was enforceable without being adapted; and

3.         determining placement.

[27]           Dual criminality means that the crime for which the offender was sentenced in another country must also be a crime in Canada.  Under s. 4 of the ITOA, the “Canadian offender’s conduct must constitute a criminal offence if it had occurred in Canada at the time the Minister of Public receives the request for transfer “, and, s. 4(2) of the ITOA further provides that, “it is not relevant whether the conduct … is named, defined or characterized by the foreign entity [making the transfer] in the same way as it is in Canada”.

[28]           In the result, Mr. Khadr was transferred to Canada on September 29, 2012 and placed in federal penitentiary, first the Millhaven Institution and later (May 2013 and continuing now) the Edmonton Institution.

[29]           Mr. Khadr, through his lawyer, demanded that the Warden of the Edmonton Institution release him, relying on s. 20 of the ITOA.  The demand was refused and in the result he sought habeas corpus to release him and an Order for placement in an adult provincial correctional facility.

[30]           Therefore, the issue in this case is whether Mr. Khadr’s placement in the federal penitentiary system is consistent with the proper statutory interpretation of the provisions of the applicable statutes. Such issues in the Court are questions of law for which the standard is correctness: Grant v Canada, at paras. 27 -8:

Questions of statutory interpretation … are generally considered questions of law, for which the Court will undertake its own analysis of the question, without showing deference to the decision maker’s reasoning process.

VIII.   Analysis
A.   If sentenced in Canada, how would this sentence be applied: as consecutive or concurrent sentences?
[39]           It is clear that Mr. Khadr pleaded guilty to five offences and was sentenced to an eight- year global period of confinement. He was transferred to Canada to serve that sentence. It is also true that neither the Convening Authority in the United States, nor the transfer process, apportioned the eight year global sentence, nor, obviously, was there any indication whether the sentence was concurrent or consecutive.

[40]           Canadian law provides that if sentences are not expressed to be consecutive (where that is available in law), they are deemed to be concurrent: s. 719(1) of the Criminal Code; C. Ruby, Sentencing, 3rd ed. (Canada: LexisNexis, 2012) p 541, para 14.2. The sentence for each conviction, unless specifically delayed for some lawful provision and purpose, commences on the date it/they are imposed: s. 719(1) of the Criminal Code – thus, in that sense alone, these sentences are concurrent. Sentences should be concurrent where there is “one continuous criminal act” or a “single criminal enterprise” (R v Oldham, 11 NSR (2d) 312 (NSCA) at para 13; R v McCrea, 2008 BCCA 227 at paras 6-8), but may be consecutive if there is a break in a continuous act or transaction, or where there the timing or character of the offences are unrelated and disparate.

[41]           An eight-year global sentence, without recognition of specific periods, may be compared to the Canadian concept of “totality”.  Under the totality principle, sentences must be “just and appropriate” under the circumstances and our courts have ensured that the total of a consecutive sentence must be commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the moral blameworthiness of the offender: R v Leasak, 2007 ABCA 38, at para 14.

[42]           The Convening Authority did not specify concurrent or consecutive because it did not sentence on each count. In the absence of any indication of a “totality” sentence, I conclude that this global sentence, if imposed in Canada, would have been five sentences to be served concurrently, at least one of which was a sentence for eight years.

B.     Are the sentences adult or youth sentences for the purposes of the ITOA?
[43]           The next step is determining if the sentences are youth or adult sentences. Sections 18 of the ITOA deals with this question. I accept that the eight-year sentence for murder, standing alone, must be a youth sentence, as in Canada there is a minimum sentence of life for an adult convicted of murder (s. 235 of the Criminal Code).  The maximum sentence for a youth convicted of murder is ten years (s. 42(2)(q) of YCJA). On the other offences, however, a youth sentence greater than three years is not available.

[44]           The parties disagree with respect to these four less serious offences. Canada asserted that Mr. Khadr was sentenced to adult sentences for the four lesser offences, while Mr. Khadr asserted that the global sentence was a youth sentence. 

[45]           Under s. 18 of the ITOA an offender will be deemed to be serving an adult sentence if he was 14 to 17 years old at the time the offence was committed and his sentence is longer than the maximum youth sentence that could have been imposed under that Act for an equivalent offence. Mr. Khadr was 15 at the time the five offences were committed and 26 years at the time of transfer. The maximum youth sentence is ten years for murder, three years for attempted murder and two years for the other offences.  If each of the sentences is eight years, as argued by Canada, the latter four sentences exceed the youth sentence maximum, and therefore under s. 18(b) of the ITOA, eight years for each of the other four offences is more than the maximum for a youth sentence if committed in Canada and he would be deemed to be serving an adult sentence.

[46]           Mr. Khadr argued that the sentences must be youth sentences because the seriousness of the alleged charges and stipulated facts suggest that an adult sentence would have been much higher than eight years.

[47]           The reality is that both these assertions are a fiction, since the Convening Authority did not sentence on each count and did not, in fact, allocate any particular sentence to any particular offence. I agree with Canada that Mr. Khadr’s argument essentially sought re-sentencing, but the same can be said of Canada’s argument, since the Convening Authority did not sentence Mr. Khadr to five eight-year concurrent sentences, but to a global sentence of eight years.

[48]           The result is that Mr. Khadr was not given adult or youth sentences for those offences, and the Court must, if possible, apply s. 18 to determine the characterization of the eight year global sentence.  Section 18 is a “deeming” provision.  A “deeming provision” is akin to a legal fiction, adopted to avoid having to adduce evidence to prove a particular fact (Townsend v Kroppmanns, 2004 SCC 10 at para 12; Dreco Energy Services Ltd. v Wenzel Downhole, 2006 ABCA 39 at para 24). A deeming provision could solve the problem where there is no way to determine how the sentences were apportioned.

[49]           As at least one of the sentences, or the global sentence, is eight years, s. 18 can reasonably be applied to deem that this sentence was a youth sentence because the murder charge, standing alone, would have attracted a minimum life sentence as an adult sentence. Therefore, even though the Convening Authority did not actually impose a youth sentence, the Court can deem it to be a youth sentence.

[50]           But what about the other offences? Canada, through the CSC determined that, in the absence of any specification of the sentence for the five individual offences and sentences transferred, they should all be treated as five concurrent sentences of eight years.

[51]           Each of these sentences is longer than the maximum youth sentence and therefore under s. 18 must be deemed to be adult sentences.

C.   Should Mr. Khadr be placed in a federal penitentiary or in an adult provincial facility?
[52]           Sections 20 and 21 of the ITOA set out placement.  Under s. 20(a) of the ITOA, an offender will be detained in a provincial correctional facility for adults if the sentence imposed by the foreign entity could have been a youth sentence under the YCJA, but s. 20(b) also provides that an offender will be detained in a penitentiary if their sentence is at least two years and if the sentence imposed by the foreign entity could have been an adult sentence. Further, s. 21 provides that, subject to s. 20, a Canadian offender who was detained in a foreign entity and sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more will be detained in Canada in a penitentiary. 

[53]           Mr. Khadr’s sentence could have been a single youth sentence and four adult sentences. However, Mr. Khadr obviously cannot be in both an adult provincial facility for adults and a penitentiary at the same time. Principles of statutory interpretation provide that legislation should not be interpreted in a way that produces absurd results or results that are inconsistent with the purpose of the legislation: Alberta Union of Provincial Employees v Lethbridge Community College, 2004 SCC 28 at para 46.  Therefore the question is where is an offender sentenced to both youth and adult sentences to serve that sentence.

[54]           This analysis requires reading together the ITOA, ss. 92(4) and 76(1) (c) of the YCJA and s. 743.5 of the Criminal Code.  Under this analysis, Mr. Khadr was sentenced to one youth sentence under s. 42(2)(q) of the YCJA for murder and four adult sentences of eight years for the other four offences. Under s. 743.5 where an offender is serving both youth and adult sentences, the disposition of the sentences are to be dealt with “as if it had been a sentence imposed under [the Criminal Code]”. Under ss. 76(1)(c) and 92(4) of the YCJA, Mr. Khadr is to be placed in a federal penitentiary.

[55]           Thus, Mr. Khadr’s placement in a federal penitentiary is lawful and the habeas corpus application is denied. Once this determination is made, the sentences are then merged, pursuant to s. 139 of the CCRA into one sentence for future purposes of administering post sentencing administration.
