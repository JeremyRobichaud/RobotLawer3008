[22]           Therefore, I have concluded that the intention of the Accused on these facts does not convert the desperate events of October 3, 2008 and October 10, 2008 into the same transaction. The offences are related and connected but remain discrete. As a result the attempted murder charge cannot stand on the same Indictment as the charge of murder, because they are different transactions.

 

[23]           In my view where, by virtue of s. 589 an indictment includes a charge which should not be joined with a charge of murder, it is unnecessary to determine whether the principles of severance apply. The Indictment is properly severed into two Indictments.

 

[24]           Counsel have agreed that if I came to this conclusion, the trial of the Indictment charging murder would proceed and that charging the Accused with the attempted murder of Mr. Tetreault would be adjourned. That Order will go.

 

Heard on the 14th day of October, 2010.

Dated at the City of Edmonton, Alberta this 22nd day of October, 2010.
