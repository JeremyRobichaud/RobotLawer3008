COUNT TWO:  THE ALLEGED ASSAULT BY RYAN ON MATTHEW GAUTHIER
[4]         The assault alleged in count two occurred immediately before the assault that gave rise to count one in the indictment.  We will begin with a brief outline of the facts relevant to count two, even though there is no appeal from the acquittal on that count.

[5]         Ryan, Jordan, Mr. Doan, and Mr. Gauthier were among many guests attending a party at a camp (cottage) held to celebrate an upcoming wedding.  Ryan and Jordan were related to the bride.  Mr. Gauthier was the best man and Mr. Doan was a close friend of Mr. Gauthier.  The party started early in the afternoon and extended into the early morning the following day.  There was a lot of drinking.  Everyone was having fun and enjoying themselves. 

[6]         Sometime shortly after midnight, the festive mood suddenly changed.  Mr. Doan, who had been drinking a lot, began to tease a teenage boy in a sexually suggestive manner.  The teenager understandably took issue with Mr. Doan’s comments.  A verbal exchange, with some physical interaction between Mr. Doan and the teenage boy, ensued. 

[7]         Ryan, who had also been drinking a lot, and was a friend of the teenage boy, became angry with Mr. Doan’s treatment of the young man.  He stepped in to defend his friend.  Ryan and Mr. Doan exchanged words and began a physical confrontation.  Things became more heated and the two men found themselves outside on the deck of the cottage in a face-to-face confrontation. 

[8]         As Ryan and Mr. Doan faced each other in the middle of a gathering crowd, Mr. Gauthier came through the crowd intent on helping his friend, Mr. Doan.  According to defence witnesses, Mr. Gauthier, who was a large and muscular young man, pushed Ryan backwards into the wall of the cottage and advanced on him with his arms raised.  Ryan responded with a single punch striking Mr. Gauthier in the head and knocking him to the ground unconscious. 

[9]         The trial judge carefully considered the conflicting versions of the relevant events and ultimately preferred Ryan’s evidence over the evidence relied on by the Crown (see paras. 37-38).  The trial judge was not satisfied that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ryan did not act in self-defence.[1]  He acquitted Ryan on count two.  

COUNT ONE:  THE ASSAULT ON JAKE DOAN
[10]      Immediately after Ryan knocked Mr. Gauthier to the floor on the deck of the cottage, Mr. Doan ran (or was chased) out onto the lawn.  Jordan admitted in his testimony that as Mr. Doan was running across the lawn, he punched Mr. Doan as hard as he could in the face knocking him to the ground.  Jordan claimed that he was defending himself from the oncoming Mr. Doan.  Others testified that Jordan chased Mr. Doan and “sucker punched” him from the side or behind knocking him to the ground. 

[11]      Mr. Doan suffered a very serious eye injury.  He is virtually blind in his right eye and there is very little prospect that his sight will ever improve. 

[12]      Various witnesses testified that Ryan was chasing Mr. Doan when Jordan knocked Mr. Doan to the ground.  According to these witnesses, Ryan kicked and punched Mr. Doan as he lay on the ground semi-conscious.  Within a few seconds, several other people piled on top of Mr. Doan.  The owner of the cottage quickly interceded and pulled Mr. Doan out of the pile. 

[13]      The trial judge rejected Jordan’s self-defence claim holding, at para. 88:

In reviewing the totality of the evidence and finding as a fact that Jordan Rocchetta was running behind Jake Doan, that he caught up to Jake Doan, at which point he struck Doan in the face, I am satisfied that the Crown has discharged its burden of proof and established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was not acting in lawful self-defence. 

[14]      The trial judge also found that the blow administered by Jordan caused Mr. Doan’s serious eye injury and that the injury was sufficient in law to justify a conviction on the aggravated assault charge (see paras. 98-100).

[15]      The trial judge rejected the Crown’s argument that Ryan was a party to Jordan’s aggravated assault (see paras. 103-113).  However, he convicted Ryan of the included offence of common assault based on the punches and kicks administered by Ryan after Mr. Doan had been knocked to the ground by Jordan (see paras. 76, 119).
