Constable Boudreau was at work at the Bathurst police force detachment on January 12, 2015 when he was informed by his supervisor of a tip that had been received from New Brunswick Crime Stoppers. As pointed out by the preliminary inquiry judge, the actual tip which triggered the unfolding of a series of events on January 12, 2015, is subject to a sealing order issued by a judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench.

 [6.]           Sergeant Ron DaSylva was the supervisor of the North East Integrated Intelligence Unit in January 2015. At the preliminary inquiry, he testified to receiving an anonymous Crime Stoppers tip on the morning of January 12, 2015. The tip was relayed to Officer DaSylva via email. Officer DaSylva was informed by reading this Crime Stoppers tip that an individual by the name of Michel Vienneau was arriving on the train from Montreal that morning with drugs. Michel Vienneau’s common law spouse was also named in the tip, which included information that Annick Basque was traveling on the train with Mr. Vienneau. Finally, the tip identified the make and model of the vehicle driven by Mr. Vienneau.

 [7.]           Sergeant DaSylva shared the information contained in the tip with the individuals in the office that morning. These individuals included Sergeant George Richard of the Bathurst – Nigadoo – Petit-Rocher – Pointe Verte Police Force, more commonly referred to as the BNPP, Constable Larry Matchett of the Miramichi Police Force, Constable Denis Lajoie of the RCMP, Constable Boudreau, and Constable Patrick Bulger.

 [8.]           Constable Patrick Bulger called the Bathurst train station and determined that the train was arriving late, between 10:30 and 10:45. As the train had not yet arrived, Constable Boudreau, Sergeant Richard, Constable Matchett, Constable Lajoie and Officer Julie Daigle proceeded to the train station in various unmarked police vehicles. Upon their arrival, Constable Bulger organised the location of the various officers and vehicles in order to undertake surveillance and wait for the arrival of the train.

 [9.]           The train arrived at the Bathurst Station and Mr. Vienneau, accompanied by Ms. Basque, were identified by the officers as they exited the train and proceeded to their car. The various officers involved were sitting in unmarked police vehicles located at different spots in and around the parking lot of the train station. After clearing the vehicle of snow and taking a photo of the train, Mr. Vienneau joined Ms. Basque in the vehicle, a white Chevrolet Cruz, and started to reverse.

 [10.]      As the Vienneau vehicle began to reverse, the unmarked police vehicle driven by Constable Boudreau, who was accompanied by Constable Bulger, also started to reverse. In effecting this manoeuvre, Constable Boudreau brought his vehicle nose to nose with the Vienneau vehicle. The Vienneau vehicle continued its motion, striking the police vehicle.

 [11.]      At that point, Constable Bulger had already exited the vehicle with his sidearm drawn. The Vienneau vehicle continued its forward motion while Constable Bulger was in front of the vehicle. While trying to get away from the Vienneau vehicle, Constable Bulger lost his footing in the snow and fell to the ground. Constable Boudreau realized that Constable Bulger had fallen in the path of the Vienneau vehicle. Constable Boudreau shot at the driver, Mr. Vienneau, to stop the vehicle. Tragically, Mr. Vienneau died as a result of a gunshot wound.
