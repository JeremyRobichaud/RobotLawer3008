II.        Facts
[4]               On April 5, 2017, the complainant returned to his rural home where he lived alone, and found the front door kicked in. His property can be accessed by two driveways – one east-facing and the other west-facing; he entered his property from the west driveway. He noticed fresh tire tracks on the east-facing driveway. Once in the house, he discovered several firearms and ammunition were missing.

[5]               After calling the Sherwood Park RCMP, the complainant heard an engine revving somewhere down his east driveway. He drove around his property again using the west-facing driveway; seeing nothing, he returned using the same driveway. He estimated he was gone only two to four minutes, and when he returned, a blue Dodge truck had backed in towards his house. He left his vehicle and heard some noise from inside the house; he again called 911.

[6]               The complainant decided to slash the front tires of the blue Dodge truck in order to prevent the driver from leaving the property before the police arrived. He then saw a large Rottweiler dog coming toward him from the direction of his house, followed by a man, the appellant. The complainant testified that both the appellant and the dog must have come from his house.

[7]               The appellant told the complainant that he was looking for his dog; the complainant did not believe the appellant, and told him to get to the ground until the police arrived. Instead, the appellant and the dog jumped into the blue Dodge truck and drove down the east driveway. The complainant jumped in his car, backed out the west driveway and as he came to the township road, he observed the truck “shooting out of his east driveway”.

[8]               The complainant followed the blue Dodge truck, reaching speeds of 120-130 km/h, while again calling 911. The driver of the blue Dodge truck ultimately lost control of the vehicle and went into the ditch. The complainant observed the appellant throw “some things” out of the truck, before the appellant managed to manoeuvre the truck out of the ditch and continue about another 1.5 kms down the road. The appellant stopped again, grabbed some things, and he and the Rottweiler dog ran off into the bushes. There were no other people in the isolated area.

[9]               When the police arrived, a police tracker dog ultimately located the appellant and Rottweiler. The police arrested the appellant, who was wearing the same clothing as described by the complainant in his 911 calls, and was searched incidental to arrest. The ignition key for the blue Dodge truck was found on the key chain located in the appellant’s pocket. A search of the vehicle revealed some ammunition of the same type that the complainant had reported stolen from his home.

[10]           The complainant testified that a few days later he and a neighbor went back to the location where he had previously observed the appellant tossing things from the blue Dodge truck into the ditch. At the site, they located ammunition which was contained in a bread bag the complainant recognized as the one in which he kept his ammunition; at the same time, the complainant recovered some cigars which he stated had been taken from the refrigerator in his home.

[11]           The appellant did not testify and called no evidence in his defence. He conceded the offences of driving while disqualified and breach of recognizance to keep the peace; convictions were entered on those two counts.
