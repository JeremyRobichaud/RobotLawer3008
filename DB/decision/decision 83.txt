XII.     Conclusion
[89]           Considering the statutory factors set out above, the values, principles, objectives, concepts and factors of sentencing, the character of the offender and analysis of future dangerousness, the nature of the offence, the elements of denunciation and deterrence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, aggravating and mitigating factors, the victim impact statements and the case authorities presented by counsel, Mr. Beglau is sentenced to prison for life. He will not be eligible to apply for parole for a first time until he has served 13 years of that sentence, to be calculated by the Parole Board of Canada (R v Ryan at para 23).

[90]           Pursuant to Criminal Code s 190(2), Mr. Beglau is prohibited from:

1.         possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, any crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substances for ten years after his release from imprisonment after conviction for the offence, and

2.         any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition for life.

[91]           He is directed to provide a sample of bodily substance sufficient for DNA analysis, pursuant to Criminal Code s 487.051.

[92]           He is prohibited from communicating, directly or indirectly, with Brianna Beglau, Corey Beglau or Gerald Meyer during the custodial period of the sentence pursuant to Criminal Code s 743.21(1).

[93]           Mr. Beglau’s cell phone and computer are to be wiped of such information and content as agreed between counsel and advised to the police, and then they, along with Mr. Beglau’s personal property that was on his person at the time of his arrest, can be provided to his designated family members. I also order delivery of Ms. Hunter’s iPad and cell phone to Corey Beglau, and all other objects and documents to be forfeited to the Crown. Specifics of forfeiture will be addressed by communication from counsel to the police.

[94]           Defence counsel has asked that I consider a non-binding recommendation that Mr. Beglau serve his sentence in the minimum security institution at Bowden. I leave that determination to the corrections authorities, who are better equipped to make that determination.

[95]           Finally, Mr. Beglau is to pay a victim fine surcharge of $200, deemed one day in default.

[96]           These Reasons will become part of Mr. Beglau’s prison file.
