18                              The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on the effect of anger on criminal intent or mens rea and its relationship to manslaughter.  This error was not corrected on the recharge and we cannot infer from the way the trial proceeded that the jury’s verdict of manslaughter was not based on the erroneous initial direction.  It follows that the conviction for manslaughter must be set aside and a new trial directed.




19                              As indicated earlier, the Crown in this appeal, relied solely on the trial judge’s misdirections on anger and criminal intent.  It is therefore unnecessary to comment further on the applicability of the defence of provocation as it may be tendered at the new trial.  It will be for the judge on the new trial to determine whether, on the evidence there presented, the defence of provocation should be put to the jury.



20                              I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial on second degree murder.
