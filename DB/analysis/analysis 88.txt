There is a presumption of judicial impartiality, which must be displaced by the appellants. The threshold is a high one, and properly so. ... [Emphasis added.]

[13]           I find that a reasonable and informed person would not conclude that a reasonable apprehension of bias is established in this situation, particularly since I have acknowledged and accepted that Mr. Vader was incorrectly convicted of second degree murder under Criminal Code, s 230. That is the first reason for rejecting the defence mistrial application.

[14]           Second, a reasonable and informed person would not think that I am unable to sentence Mr. Vader on a less serious offense when I had found him guilty of a more serious offense. Parliament via Criminal Code, ss 686(1)(b)(i), 686(3)(b) authorizes appeal courts to substitute a verdict and remit the matter to the trial court and “... direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.” For example, see R v Perjalian, 2011 BCCA 323 at para 77, 308 BCAC 232; R v DAG, 1995 ABCA 32 at para 16, 165 AR 49; R v Breton, 2016 ONCA 425 at para 18.

[15]           If the defence theory concerning bias was correct; a trial judge could never sentence an offender for a lesser offence per Criminal Code, s 686(3)(b) because the original conviction on the more serious charge would raise an apprehension of bias, and make the re-sentencing by that judge a breach of procedural fairness. This is not correct at law.

[16]           Therefore, for these reasons, I reject the mistrial application and dismiss it.

IV.      Substitution of Verdicts
[17]           I incorrectly found Mr. Vader guilty and convicted him of the second degree murder of Lyle and Marie McCann. For me to proceed to sentence Mr. Vader on the basis of legally unsustainable verdicts and related convictions would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[18]           It is common ground that this Court retains jurisdiction until a sentence has been imposed, and that the Court has authority to substitute a verdict made in error: R v Griffith, 2013 ONCA 510, 309 OAC 159.

[19]           These are “exceptional circumstances” where the appropriate response is for the Court to reopen the verdicts and the related convictions entered in Vader and vacate them.

[20]           The defence argues any step I take must be in compliance with Criminal Code, s 662(3). This provision has no application since it relates to jury trials. Mr. Vader was tried in a judge-alone proceeding.

[21]           At paras 676-677 of Vader, I concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Vader committed homicide. He killed the McCanns to facilitate his robbing of them: Vader at paras 687-691.

[22]           Culpable homicide is murder or manslaughter or infanticide: Criminal Code, s 222(4). Infanticide is obviously irrelevant. I concluded at Vader, paras 684-686 that Travis Vader is not guilty of first degree murder. I have accepted that I incorrectly found Mr. Vader guilty of second degree murder. A culpable homicide that is not murder is manslaughter.

[23]           I vacate the finding in Vader that Travis Vader is guilty of second degree murder for his killing of Lyle and Marie McCann, and also vacate the related convictions entered by me on September 15th. I substitute the verdicts of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for the lesser and included offenses of manslaughter of Lyle and Marie McCann near Peers, Alberta, on or about July 3, 2010. On October 31st, I entered convictions based on these verdicts for manslaughter and those convictions are confirmed.
