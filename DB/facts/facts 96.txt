[1]               Bernard Corrigan plead guilty to this charge:

On or about June 13th, 2018, at or near Fort McMurray, Alberta, knowing that Trevor Bown had murdered John Healey, Bernard Corrigan did assist Trevor Bown for the purpose of enabling him to escape arrest contrary to section 240 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

Circumstances of the Offence

[2]               Mr. Corrigan admitted facts which establish that he committed this crime.  I will summarize them:

a.      On June 12, 2018 Mr. Corrigan, who had a substance abuse problem, was at a house in Fort McMurray with several other people, including Trevor Bown, smoking drugs and drinking alcohol.

b.      Someone advised Mr. Bown that John Healey had been released from police custody.  Mr. Bown told Mr. Corrigan that he wanted Mr. Corrigan to drive him somewhere. Mr. Corrigan customarily drove for Mr. Bown whenever they travelled together.  Mr. Bown did not tell Mr. Corrigan what they were going to do on the trip.  Mr. Corrigan believed they were going to buy more drugs.

c.      Mr. Bown had an automatic machine-pistol concealed on his person.  Mr. Corrigan knew that Mr. Bown regularly carried firearms.

d.      Mr. Bown told Mr. Corrigan where in Fort McMurray to go.

e.      At some point as they drove, Mr. Bown showed Mr. Corrigan the gun.  He told Mr. Corrigan that they were going to pick up Mr. Healey who had stolen money and owed huge debts [presumably from and to Mr. Bown].  Mr. Corrigan did not know Mr. Healey.  At a later point in the drive, before they picked up Mr. Healey, Mr. Bown told Mr. Corrigan that he intended to shoot Mr. Healey.  He “suggested they do a ‘drive-by shooting’.  Mr. Corrigan told Mr. Bown that a drive-by shooting was a bad idea.  He was concerned about the firearm, and that if he refused Mr. Bown’s request that Mr. Bown would harm him.  Mr. Bown said it was too late and ‘that it had to get done’”.

f.      They picked up Mr. Healey.  Mr. Bown directed Mr. Corrigan to drive to a construction road near a Fort McMurray neighborhood.  As they drove, Mr. Bown and Mr. Healey were talking and began to argue.  Mr. Healey got nervous and asked what was happening.  Mr. Corrigan told Mr. Healey that Mr. Bown was going to kill him.

g.      Mr. Bown directed Mr. Corrigan to stop.  Mr. Bown ordered Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Healey to exit the car.  Mr. Bown got out and fired at least 11 rounds towards Mr. Healey’s back, hitting him three times.  In shooting at Mr. Healey, Mr. Bown fired past Mr. Corrigan, and Mr. Corrigan initially thought that Mr. Bown was shooting towards him.

h.      Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Bown got back in the vehicle and Mr. Corrigan drove them away, leaving Mr. Healey’s body on the scene.  Mr. Healey died either as he was shot or shortly thereafter.  His body was discovered hours later.

i.        Mr. Corrigan drove back to the house from which the trip had originated.  Shortly before arriving there, at Mr. Bown’s direction, he stopped and let Mr. Bown out of the vehicle.

j.        On arrival at the house, Mr. Corrigan parked the car in the driveway.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bown arrived at the house on foot.  Mr. Corrigan gave the car keys to someone who moved the car inside the garage and closed the garage door.

k.      “Mr. Corrigan and others took steps to clean the car and remove evidence.  In particular, a shell casing from the bullets fired at the murder scene landed in the depression between the trunk and the rear windshield of the Verano [the vehicle].  Mr. Corrigan picked up this casing and put it in his pocket.  He later took the casing and threw it away down a manhole in the street.  The casing was not recovered.”

l.        Police investigation of the homicide included a warranted search on June 17, 2018, of the house to which Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Bown had returned.  Police obtained surveillance videos of the relevant time.  They identified Mr. Corrigan as a person of interest in the investigation.

m.   On July 19, 2018 [the Agreed Statement of Facts says 2019 but this must be an error] Mr. Corrigan was arrested on an unrelated warrant.

n.      Police interviewed Mr. Corrigan about the homicide while he was in custody.  He was told that he was not in custody in relation to the homicide and was free to leave and that he did not have to speak to police about the homicide but that if he did what he said could be used as evidence against him.

o.      In the interview, Mr. Corrigan chose to speak to police at length.  He admitted driving Mr. Bown to and from the murder.  He told police that Mr. Bown had committed the murder, described the firearm and how Mr. Bown had committed the murder.  He voluntarily went with police investigators to the scene of the homicide and re-enacted the murder.  He showed them the path that Mr. Bown had taken with Mr. Healey and where and how Mr. Bown shot Mr. Healey.

p.      Mr. Corrigan was released from custody.  He was not charged in connection with the homicide.  He travelled out of Alberta until September 2018.  He returned to Fort McMurray on September 14, 2018 and was arrested on arrival.

q.      Mr. Corrigan was again interviewed by police.  He was told that he might be charged with murder.  He was even more forthcoming in this second interview than he had been in the first.  He provided a thorough, detailed statement to police about the events surrounding Mr. Healey’s death.  He maintained throughout that he had not known that Mr. Bown planned to kill Mr. Healey until it was too late and felt his life was also in danger if he challenged Mr. Bown.  He admitted that he had taken part in the cleaning of the car, and particularly, that he had disposed of a shell casing that was left on the rear windshield area.  He voluntarily accompanied the police to the area where he had disposed of the shell casing.  The police were not able to find the casing.

r.        The information Mr. Corrigan provided was critical to the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Bown.  Though there were some material inaccuracies and omissions in his statements, his account was largely consistent with other extrinsic evidence collected by the police.

s.      On May 13, 2019, Mr. Bown plead guilty to second degree murder for killing Mr. Healey.

t.        Mr. Corrigan has been in custody since his arrest on September 15, 2018.  He made no application for judicial interim release.
