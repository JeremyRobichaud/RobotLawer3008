Is s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms offended by the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years, where the victim of the murder is a police officer as described in s. 214(4) of the Criminal Code?

[74]                       Section 12 of the Charter reads as follows:

12. Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.

[75]                       The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are as follows:

214. (1) Murder is first degree murder or second degree murder.

(2) Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

(3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is planned and deliberate when it is committed pursuant to an arrangement under which money or anything of value passes or is intended to pass from one person to another, or is promised by one person to another, as consideration for that other’s causing or assisting in causing the death of anyone or counselling another person to do any act causing or assisting in causing that death.

(4) Irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder when the victim is

(a) a police officer, police constable, constable, sheriff, deputy sheriff, sheriff’s officer or other person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace, acting in the course of his duties;

(b) a warden, deputy warden, instructor, keeper, gaoler, guard or other officer or a permanent employee of a prison, acting in the course of his duties; or

(c) a person working in a prison with the permission of the prison authorities and acting in the course of his work therein.

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person while committing or attempting to commit an offence under one of the following sections:

(a) section 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft);

(b) section 246.1 (sexual assault);

(c) section 246.2 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm);

(d) section 246.3 (aggravated sexual assault);

(e) section 247 (kidnapping and forcible confinement); or

(f) section 247.1 (hostage taking).

(6) [Repealed. 1985, c. 19, s. 35.]

(7) All murder that is not first degree murder is second degree murder.

218. (1) Every one who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

669. The sentence to be pronounced against a person who is to be sentenced to imprisonment for life shall be,

(a) in respect of a person who has been convicted of high treason or first degree murder, that he be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence;

(a.1) in respect of a person who has been convicted of second degree murder where he has previously been convicted of culpable homicide that is murder, however described under this Act, that he be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence;

(b) in respect of a person who has been convicted of second degree murder, that he be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he has served at least ten years of his sentence or such greater number of years, not being more than twenty-five years, as has been substituted therefor pursuant to section 671; and

(c) in respect of a person who has been convicted of any other offence, that he be sentenced to imprisonment for life with normal eligibility for parole.

[76]                       Each punishment assigned by Parliament must be scrutinized on its own to determine whether there it is capable of applying to facts in regard to which the punishment would be grossly disproportionate to the circumstances of the offence. Where no mandatory minimum sentence is assigned by Parliament, but only a maximum, it is difficult to conceive of an arguable issue arising. The issue is more obviously a real one where Parliament has assigned a mandatory minimum sentence, especially a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration, or a mandatory fixed period of imprisonment such as imprisonment for life.

[77]                       In the present case, counsel for the accused Kay, Mr. O’Brien, contends that there is gross disproportion between the offence and the mandatory punishment of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for a period of at least 25 years. He argues that, where there is a conviction of first degree murder requiring the imposition of that punishment simply because the victim was a police officer, and Parliament requires that the offence receive the same punishment as that required in the case of a “planned and deliberate” first degree murder, that demonstrates a gross disproportion. He points out that Parliament requires that the same punishment be imposed upon such an offender even if the killing of the policeman, while intentional and therefore murder, was nevertheless impulsive. He argues that the result in such a case would be that an offender whose moral culpability is of a lesser degree than that of an offender who has committed a planned and deliberate murder must receive the same punishment as the latter. In the context of his attack based on s. 12 of the Charter, he argues that this demonstrates the gross disproportionality of the mandatory punishment of the murder of a police officer.

[78]                       In my view this argument is founded upon a false premise. The premise is that gross disproportionality between the offence and the sentence may be demonstrated by comparing the degree to which one ingredient is present when Parliament has required that a particular mandatory sentence be imposed with the degree to which it may be absent in some cases in which Parliament has required that the same sentence be imposed. This premise is faulty for two reasons or subpremises. First, it assumes without justification that the ingredient that is the basis upon which Parliament required the imposition of that sentence in the first instance is the only ingredient which, if gross disproportionality is to be avoided, can justify the statutorily mandated sentence. That assumption cannot be made justifiably in this instance. What Parliament has said, in effect, is that more than one kind of murder is to attract the mandatory punishment that is conveniently described under the rubric “first degree murder”.

[79]                       One such kind of murder is when the murder is “planned and deliberate”: s. 214(2).

[80]                       Another such kind of murder, as defined by s. 214(3), is called a “contract killing” – what Manning and Mewett, Criminal Law, 2nd ed. (1985), p. 548, paraphrasing the subsection, call a murder “committed pursuant to an arrangement whereby money or any other valuable passes in consideration for the killing or arranging for the killing”. In that situation Parliament has said that the murder is planned and deliberate, but there might be circumstances where that could not be said to be true of the principal or of a party to the arrangement, yet Parliament desired that such a killing should attract the same mandatory punishment because of its heinous nature.

[81]                       Another kind of murder that Parliament has decided is to attract the same mandatory punishment is found in s. 214(4), with which we are concerned in this case: where the victim of the murder is a police officer or a prison officer or a person working in a prison. In this situation, obviously, Parliament had in mind the same need for protection as at common law made the killing of a police officer murder when it might otherwise have been manslaughter, at a time when murder was a capital offence. This policy was described by Stephen’s Digest of the Criminal Law, 7th ed. (1926), p. 225, as follows:

Malice aforethought [which was a common law requirement of murder] means … An intent to oppose by force any officer of justice on his way to, in, or returning from the duty of arresting … any person whom he is lawfully entitled to arrest … provided that the offender has notice that the person killed is such an officer employed.

[82]                       Similarly, Russell on Crime, 9th ed. (1936), Pt. I, p. 412, stated:

When a constable … acts in the execution of his duty, the law casts a peculiar protection round him, and consequently, if he is killed in the execution of his duty, it is in general murder, even though there be circumstances of hot blood and want of premeditation as would in an ordinary case reduce the crime to manslaughter. In the earlier authorities such killing is described as of malice aforethought, as being an outrage wilfully committed in defiance of the justice of the kingdom.

(Both these passages were quoted in R. v. Appleby (1940), 28 Cr. App. R. 1 at 4). The provisions in s. 214(4), intended to protect a police officer or a prison officer, were introduced by amendments to the Bill introduced in the House of Commons in 1961 when the penalty for murder, until then the death penalty in all cases, was being bifurcated into capital murder and non-capital murder, and the listed situations in which murder was to be capital murder before the amendment included “planned and deliberate” murder but did not include cases where the victim is a police officer or prison officer. When, in 1976, the present structure and rubrics found in s. 214 were adopted, this situation was continued as one of the instances in which murder was to be treated as “first degree murder”, which no longer attracted the death penalty but, instead, imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years.

[83]                       Another set of situations which attracts that punishment is that enumerated in s. 214(5), where the killing occurs while the offender is committing or attempting to commit hijacking of an aircraft, sexual assault, kidnapping or forcible confinement, or hostage taking. In this case, it is safe to assume that Parliament was of the view that passengers on aircraft, women or other potential victims of sexual assault, persons taken or confined against their will and hostages were entitled to special protection even if the killing was not planned and deliberate.

[84]                       None of these instances in which the penalty for murder is to be imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years has a position of paramountcy over the others. In each instance that punishment has been assigned because of the gravity of the circumstances of the offence as seen by Parliament.

[85]                       The second faulty subpremise upon which the argument of the defence rests is that the severity of the punishment for murdering a police officer must be graded in severity against the severity of the punishment assigned to planned and deliberate murder. That assumption is wrong logically and in law. It is wrong logically because the appropriate range of punishment for planned and deliberate murder, within standards of decency, reasonably held by reasonable and dispassionate members of Canadian society, might, at its upper range, considerably exceed a period of 25 years of ineligibility for parole. In other words, for planned and deliberate murder Parliament might, without offending s. 12, have imposed a longer period of ineligibility for parole. The fact that it has not done so cannot be conclusive of what would be constitutionally permissible. Therefore, it is at least inconclusive, perhaps even of little weight, to contend that the punishment for killing a police officer must be graded against that for planned and deliberate murder. Apart from logic, the law, in the form of Lamer J.’s judgment in R. v. Smith, 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, [1987] 5 W.W.R. 1, 15 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, 58 C.R. (3d) 193 at 237, 34 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 31 C.R.R. 193, 40 D.L.R. (4th) 435, 75 N.R. 321, renders “a gradation of punishments according to the malignity of offences” irrelevant to whether one punishment is grossly disproportionate and violative of s. 12.

[86]                       I turn now to a consideration of the attack on s. 214(4) when combined with s. 218(1) and s. 669(a), in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Smith.

[87]                       In Lamer J.’s words in R. v. Smith, at p. 235, a punishment imposed by a court will be “cruel and unusual” punishment that offends s. 12 if it is such that its “effect” would be “grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate” or, in Laskin C.J.C.’s words in Miller v. R., 1976 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, [1976] 5 W.W.R. 711, 38 C.R.N.S. 139, 31 C.C.C. (2d) 177, 70 D.L.R. (3d) 324, 11 N.R. 386 [B.C.], as adopted by Lamer J. in Smith, whether the punishment prescribed would be “ ‘so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.’ ”

[88]                       According to Lamer J., who spoke in this regard on behalf of a total of four out of six judges who participated in the decision in Smith, if the question were whether a particular sentence proposed by a court was “grossly disproportionate”, the court would consider (p. 235):

… the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender or to protect the public from this particular offender.

In Lamer J.’s view, which I accept as binding, the “deterrence of other potential offenders” would be a purpose which “may be pursued by the imposition of punishment” but would “not [be] relevant” in deciding whether the sentenced is grossly disproportionate, for the question is whether the sentence is “grossly disproportionate to what the offender deserves”.

[89]                       Lamer J. then stated: “If a grossly disproportionate sentence is ‘prescribed by law’, then the purpose which it seeks to attain will fall to be assessed under s. 1”. He explained that:

Section 12 ensures that individual offenders receive punishments that are appropriate, or at least not grossly disproportionate, to their particular circumstances, while s. 1 permits this right to be overridden to achieve some important societal objective.

With respect, when the subject under analysis is whether a statutorily mandated sentence offends s. 12, it is not possible to consider “the personal characteristics of the offender” or “the particular circumstances of the case”, and the question is not “what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender or to protect the public from this particular offender”.

[90]                       For guidance as to the analysis to be undertaken where what is in issue is a statutorily mandated sentence, the next paragraph of Lamer J.’s judgment is of assistance. At p. 236, he said:

One must also measure the effect of the sentence actually imposed. If it is grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate, then it infringes s. 12. The effect of the sentence is often a composite of many factors and is not limited to the quantum or duration of the sentence but includes its nature and the conditions under which it is applied. Sometimes by its length alone or by its very nature will the sentence be grossly disproportionate to the purpose sought. Sometimes it will be the result of the combination of factors which, when considered in isolation, would not in and of themselves amount to gross disproportionality. For example, 20 years for a first offence against property would be grossly disproportionate, but so would three months of imprisonment if the prison authorities decide it should be served in solitary confinement. Finally, I should add that some punishments or treatments will always be grossly disproportionate and will always outrage our standards of decency: for example, the infliction of corporal punishment, such as the lash, irrespective of the number of lashes imposed, or, to give examples of treatment, the lobotomization of certain dangerous offenders or the castration of sexual offenders.

He then pointed out that certain criteria that had been referred to in judgments concerning s. 2(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Eighth Amendment to the American Constitution are “useful as factors to determine whether a violation of s. 12 has occurred”. He said [at p. 236] that:

… the determination of whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose, whether it is founded on recognized sentencing principles, and whether there exist valid alternatives to the punishment imposed, are all guidelines which, without being determinative in themselves, help to assess whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate.

[91]                       Lamer J. then observed that another aspect of proportionality is “a comparison with punishments imposed for other crimes in the same jurisdiction”. He continued [pp. 236-37]:

Of course, the simple fact that penalties for similar offences are divergent does not necessarily mean that the greater penalty is grossly disproportionate and thus cruel and unusual. At most, the divergence in penalties is an indication that the greater penalty may be excessive, but it will remain necessary to assess the penalty in accordance with the factors discussed above. The notion that there must be a gradation of punishments according to the malignity of offences may be considered to be a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7, but, given my decision under s. 12, I do not find it necessary to deal with that issue here.

[92]                       Finally, Lamer J. rejected the suggestion that the arbitrariness of a prescribed punishment could be relevant to whether it offends s. 12 or, at best, he regarded it as “a minimal factor in the determination of whether a punishment or treatment is cruel and unusual” (p. 238). In his view such a factor would be irrelevant because “s. 12 is concerned with the effect of a punishment” and therefore “the process by which the punishment is imposed is not … of any great relevance to a determination under s. 12” [p. 237].

[93]                       Thus it appears that in Lamer J.’s view, and in his words at p. 238, “a sentence is or is not grossly disproportionate to the purpose sought or a punishment is or is not cruel and unusual irrespective of why the violation has taken place”. From the hypothetical examples given by Lamer J. at p. 237 and the American circumstances described on p. 238, it appears that, in discussing “arbitrariness”, Lamer J. had in mind procedures followed at trial which may be said to be “arbitrary”, not the reason for which Parliament has decided that a particular crime attracts a particular mandatory sentence or (as was in issue in the Smith case) a particular mandatory minimum sentence.

[94]                       In the very passage just quoted, it is clear that Lamer J. treated as relevant a consideration of the “purpose sought” despite his affirmation (at p. 237) that “s. 12 is concerned with the effect of a punishment” and that (at p. 235) “the effect” of the punishment imposed by the state “must not be grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate”. The answer to what is, with respect, an apparent inconsistency may be that it is impossible to determine what would be “appropriate” punishment for a particular kind of offence without considering the purpose of the proscription of the conduct and the purpose of punishment for that conduct. But if that were the answer, then Lamer J. would not have stated as he did at p. 235 that the purpose which a statutorily mandated sentence seeks to attain “will fall to be assessed under s. 1”. Regretfully, I am unable to conclude that the passage “a sentence is or is not grossly disproportionate to the purpose sought” was intended to reverse the thrust of the earlier part of his judgment in which he emphasized that it is the effect of a punishment with which s. 12 is concerned.

[95]                       Besides, that is exactly the basis of the approach Lamer J. took in the Smith case to whether the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act offended s. 12. At p. 239, he stated:

At issue in this appeal is the minimum term of imprisonment provided for by s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. It thus is not necessary to delimit the scope of the terms “treatment” and “punishment”, since they clearly include the imposition by a judge of a term of imprisonment. The minimum seven-year imprisonment fails the proportionality test enunciated above and therefore prima facie infringes the guarantees established by s. 12 of the Charter. The simple fact that s. 5(2) provides for a mandatory term of imprisonment does not by itself lead to this conclusion. A minimum mandatory term of imprisonment is obviously not in and of itself cruel and unusual. The legislature may, in my view, provide for a compulsory term of imprisonment upon conviction for certain offences without infringing the rights protected by s. 12 of the Charter. For example, a long term of penal servitude for he or she who has imported large amounts of heroin for the purpose of trafficking would certainly not contravene s. 12 of the Charter, quite the contrary. However, the seven-year minimum prison term of s. 5(2) is grossly disproportionate when examined in light of the wide net cast by s. 5(1).

As indicated above, the offence of importing enacted by s. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act covers numerous substances of varying degrees of dangerousness and totally disregards the quantity of the drug imported. The purpose of a given importation, such as whether it is for personal consumption or for trafficking, and the existence or non-existence of previous convictions for offences of a similar nature or gravity are disregarded as irrelevant. Thus, the law is such that it is inevitable that, in some cases, a verdict of guilt will lead to the imposition of a term of imprisonment which will be grossly disproportionate.

This is what offends s. 12, the certainty, not just the potential. Absent the minimum, the section still has the potential of operating so as to impose cruel and unusual punishment. But that would only occur if and when a judge chose to impose, let us say, seven years or more on the “small offender”. Remedy will then flow from s. 24. It is the judge’s sentence, but not the section, that is in violation of the Charter. However, the effect of the minimum is to insert the certainty that, in some cases, as of conviction the violation will occur. It is this aspect of certainty that makes the section itself a prima facie violation of s. 12, and the minimum must, subject to s. 1, be declared of no force or effect.

[96]                       As can be seen from that passage, the basis of Lamer J.’s reasoning was that s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act would inevitably result in some cases in the imposition of a mandatory seven-year sentence that would be grossly disproportionate to the punishment that would be appropriate in the light of the gravity of the offence, the circumstances of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case. He had in mind the “small offender”, the person whom he described at p. 222 as “the tourist convicted of bringing a ‘joint’ back into the country”, who would be treated on the same footing as a “serious hard drugs dealer who is convicted of importing a large quantity of heroin”.

[97]                       I intend now to analyze s. 214(4), in combination with s. 218(1) and s. 669(a), using the same approach. Mr. O’Brien has argued that the result of these sections is that an intentional killer, who is by virtue of that intention a murderer, if he has killed without planning and deliberation, will nevertheless receive the same punishment as a murderer whose conduct has been planned and deliberate, and he will thereby suffer a cruel and unusual punishment. If his argument is to be accepted, I would have to conclude that it would be inevitable that there would be a situation in which such a sentence would be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and would be grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate. I cannot accept that there could be such a situation. If an accused killed a policeman, knowing him to be a policeman acting in the course of his duties, and did so intentionally, I believe that a sentence of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 25 years could not be said to fail those tests. It would be severe but not grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate if the sentencing judge were left with the power to impose some lesser sentence. There can be no comparison with the hypothetical extreme example in Smith of the tourist who brings a single marijuana cigarette back into Canada.

[98]                       In conclusion, s. 12 is not violated by the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years in the case of the murder of a police officer that falls within s. 214(4) of the Criminal Code.

Do the same provisions of the Criminal Code result in a violation of s. 9 of the Charter?

[99]                       Section 9 of the Charter reads:

9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.

[100]                  Counsel for the defence contends that a legislatively mandated punishment can be “arbitrary”, and that this legislatively mandated punishment is arbitrary because it must be imposed without the sentencing judge being permitted to consider the circumstances of the offence or of the offender.

[101]                  Mr. O’Brien relies upon R. v. Hufsky, 1988 CanLII 72 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621, 63 C.R. (3d) 14, 4 M.V.R. (2d) 170, 40 C.C.C. (3d) 398, 32 C.R.R. 193, 27 O.A.C. 103, 84 N.R. 365, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that held that s. 9 of the Charter was violated by a random stop of a vehicle by the police for the purposes of a spot check of registration and licensing documentation, where there was a provincial legislative provision authorizing a police officer “in the lawful execution of his duties and responsibilities”, to “require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop”. The ground of the decision by Le Dain J. for the court (at p. 23), that such a stop was “arbitrary” in the sense of s. 9, was that the provincial statutory provision did “not specify that there must be some grounds or cause for stopping a particular driver, but on its face leaves the choice of the drivers to be stopped to the discretion of the officer”. That is, he said, there was an “arbitrary detention” because “there were no criteria for the selection of the drivers to be stopped and subjected to the spot check procedure”. He added that “A discretion is arbitrary if there are no criteria, express or implied, which govern its exercise”. The circumstances in Hufsky are distinguishable from those in the present case. Here the Criminal Code leaves the sentencing judge with no discretion; nonetheless the Code states several criteria which, if they exist, result in the imposition of the fixed sentence. Those criteria consist of convictions for one or other of several situations described as first degree murder. There is no arbitrariness of the kind that existed on the facts of Hufsky.

[102]                  Then Mr. O’Brien relies upon the dissenting judgment of Lambert J.A. in R. v. Konechny, 1983 CanLII 282 (BC CA), [1984] 2 W.W.R. 481, 38 C.R. (3d) 69, 25 M.V.R. 132, 10 C.C.C. (3d) 233, 6 D.L.R. (4th) 350 (B.C.C.A.). In that case a provincial legislation provided for a minimum jail sentence of seven days upon conviction for driving a motor vehicle on a highway knowing that one’s driver’s licence is suspended. At pp. 243-45, Lambert J.A. stated:

I must consider the particular context of the words in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and I must consider the purposes of the Charter as derived from all its provisions. In that context and with those purposes in mind, I have concluded that, if a sentence of imprisonment is required by statute without regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offence or the personal circumstances of the offender, and without a reasoned application of the legal principles of sentencing, then imprisonment in accordance with that sentence is arbitrary imprisonment contrary to s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Let us suppose that there was no minimum prison term in s. 88.1. But let us suppose that a judge who convicted someone of driving while under suspension then sentenced him to serve a term of seven days’ imprisonment. Let us suppose, further, that in his reasons the sentencing judge said that general deterrence was so important that he proposed to disregard the circumstances of the offence, the circumstances of the offender and any consideration of remorse or rehabilitation, and instead intended always to impose a sentence of at least seven days’ imprisonment for a first offence of driving while under suspension. I would have no hesitation in saying that the sentencing judge had acted arbitrarily in imposing the sentence of imprisonment. He might have reached the right result, but he would have done it in an arbitrary way. I think that general deterrence should be an important factor in imposing a sentence for driving while under suspension, but to regard that factor as the only factor is, in my view, arbitrary. I think that the Legislature in this case is doing what the sentencing judge did in the example that I have given. The result is no less arbitrary.

A decision that two identical offenders who committed identical crimes in identical circumstances should receive different sentences would be regarded as arbitrary. A decision that different offenders who committed the same kind of crime but in vastly different circumstances should always receive the same sentence is no less arbitrary.

I do not intend to criticize the political decision that was made in enacting s. 88.1. Indeed, it must be regarded as a rational political decision in the sense that the policy embodied in the legislation must be taken to have been based on a sound reason. And it is not for the courts to consider whether political decisions are wise or rational, or to sit in judgment on the wisdom of legislation or the rationality of the process by which it is enacted. That is for Parliament and the Legislatures. But the courts must consider the effect of the legislation and determine whether it is in accordance with the Constitution. And the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms now requires that no one may be arbitrarily imprisoned. I think that means that each case must be individually considered and a process of reasoning applied to that individual case. A sentence of imprisonment must be a sentence that is rationally imposed on the particular individual to be imprisoned. That is the protection that is given by s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A legislative decision may be rational, as part of the process of government, but still give rise to arbitrary imprisonment, when viewed in relation to the individual offender.

[103]                  The short answer to Lambert J.A. is, in my view, found in the majority judgment of La Forest J. in the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, 61 C.R. (3d) 1, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 44 D.L.R. (4th) 193, 32 C.R.R. 41, 82 N.S.R. (2d) 271, 207 A.P.R. 271, 80 N.R. 161 (sub nom. R. v. L.). In that case the dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code were unsuccessfully attacked on the basis of ss. 7, 12 and 9 of the Charter. At p. 35, he observed that the argument based on s. 9 that the dangerous offenders provisions result in “arbitrary” imprisonment appeared “to be merely attempts to recast issues considered elsewhere in this judgment”, and in particular that:

… to the extent that they belie a fear that punishment is being imposed without due concern for the circumstances of the particular offender, I have already addressed these arguments under s. 12.

It seems to me that it is implicit in that remark that, if a legislative provision for punishment is attacked under ss. 12 and 9 on the basis that one of the “functional considerations” which at p. 22 he described as a variable in “a rational system of sentencing” is removed from the purview of the sentencing judge (the other variable being “the nature of the crime”), the appropriate focus for the constitutional attack must be s. 12, not s. 9. In other words, as between s. 9 and s. 12 the constitutional guarantee of protection against abuse of power by the state over its citizens in regard to the prescribed punishment for a particular offence or a particular status is exhaustively located in and defined by s. 12. Putting the point another way, when imprisonment arises from the imposition of punishment by a court, and that very punishment is legislatively prescribed, and the statutory procedures have been complied with (to use his language at p. 35), the “compendious norm” that the words “cruel and unusual” represent in s. 12 are a synonym for what is “arbitrary” as that word is used in s.9.

[104]                  To regard that as the short answer to Lambert J.A.’s opinion expressed in R. v. Konechny (and again in R. v. Smith (1984), 1984 CanLII 663 (BC CA), 39 C.R. (3d) 305, 11 C.C.C. (3d) 411 at 423-24, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 565, 8 C.R.R. 113 (B.C.C.A.)) is not to deny that there may in some circumstances be an overlap between two or more of the “Legal Rights” sections of the Charter. If two distinct purposes for two different sections of that part of the Charter can be articulated persuasively, then where a particular statutory enactment is to be measured against the constitutional rights guaranteed in the Charter, it must be measured against each of those sections. In the case of imprisonment prescribed by Parliament, whether it be a mandatory term or otherwise, the purpose of the protection guaranteed by s. 12 is to prevent legislative, judicial or administrative punishment or treatment that is so offensive to generally accepted standards of decency as to demand protection of the citizen against the state. The purpose of the protection guaranteed by s. 9 insofar as imprisonment following conviction is concerned, can surely be put on no higher plane nor in any other terms unless one is referring to the procedures by which a conviction or sentencing is arrived at. That is not in issue here. And no loftier purpose for s. 9 has been articulated in this court by counsel for the defence.

[105]                  My conclusion, therefore, is that s. 9 is not violated.

Do the same provisions of the Criminal Code violate s. 7 of the Charter?

[106]                  Section 7 of the Charter reads:

7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

[107]                  On behalf of the accused, Mr. O’Brien argues that sentencing the accused to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years, made mandatory by the Criminal Code, violates s. 7 of the Charter because, he says in his written submission, the following are two principles of fundamental justice that would thereby be infringed:

1. That a just and fair penal system requires a rational system of sentencing based on individualization of the sentence, which includes a consideration of the particular offence and the particular offender.

2. That a just and fair penal system requires that the sentence be based upon the moral blameworthiness of the offender in order that the “punishment fit the crime”.

His written submission adds:

The effect of s. 214(4) of the Criminal Code is to impose the most severe penalty known to our law (life twenty-five) on everyone convicted of murder with a police officer as the victim, regardless of whether or not the murder was planned and deliberate, and without any regard whatsoever to the character of the offender and the circumstances of the offence.

There can be little doubt that the circumstances surrounding the killing of a police officer may vary. For example, in R. v. Miller and Cockriel, the two accused decided upon a plan to seek out a policeman and execute him. Their plan involved a trap for a police officer who was effectively executed according to their purpose. These circumstances are drastically different from an impulsive killing of a first offender in circumstances of a panic. Also, there is no doubt that one offender convicted under s. 214(4) may have previous convictions for violence where another may have none. It is submitted that it is offensive to the principles of fundamental justice that the minimum penalty to be imposed in all cases be the most severe penalty known to criminal law.

[108]                  The implication of this argument, if accepted, would be broad. Lamer J. in R. v. Smith [1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), 58 C.R. (3d) 193] at p. 226, noted that if a statutory minimum or fixed sentence violated s. 9, provincial laws providing for fixed and minimum sentences would be affected by any decision striking down minimum sentences per se. The same would be true also of any decision striking down minimum or fixed sentences per se based on a violation of s. 7.

[109]                  In supporting his first purported principle of fundamental justice, Mr. O’Brien cites the following passage in the judgment of La Forest J. in R. v. Lyons, supra, at p. 22 [C.C.C.]:

In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender. No one would suggest that any of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.

[110]                  Mr. O’Brien relies also on the interpretation of the Eighth Amendment to the American Constitution, which proscribes cruel and unusual punishment. In Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633, 52 L. Ed. 2d 637, 97 S. Ct. 1993 (1977), the per curiam opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States stated at pp. 636-37:

In Woodson v North Carolina, 428 US 280, 304, 49 L Ed 2d 944, 95 S Ct 2978 (1976), this Court held that “the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment … requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.” In Stanislaus Roberts, 49 L Ed 2d 974, 96 S Ct 3001, we made clear that this principle applies even where the crime of first-degree murder is narrowly defined …

To be sure, the fact that the murder victim was a peace officer performing his regular duties may be regarded as an aggravating circumstance. There is a special interest in affording protection to these public servants who regularly must risk their lives in order to guard the safety of other persons and property. But it is incorrect to suppose that no mitigating circumstances can exist when the victim is a police officer. Circumstances such as the youth of the offender, the absence of any prior conviction, the influence of drugs, alcohol, or extreme emotional disturbance, and even the existence of circumstances which the offender reasonably believed provided a moral justification for his conduct are all examples of mitigating facts which might attend the killing of a peace officer and which are considered relevant in other jurisdictions.

[111]                  The rule that the Eighth Amendment requires individualized sentencing has arisen in cases involving the death penalty, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 49 L. Ed. 944, 96 S. Ct. 2978 (1976); Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 49 L. Ed. 2d 974, 96 S. Ct. 3001 (1976); Sumner v. Shuman, 97 L. Ed 2d 56, 107 S. Ct. 2716 (1987). In Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633, the United States Supreme Court, per curiam, held that the imposition of a mandatory death penalty for the intentional killing of a police officer “engaged in the performance of his lawful duties” constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

[112]                  However, it appears that in the United States the requirement, as a matter of interpretation of the constitutional imperative of the Eighth Amendment, that there be no elimination of individual sentencing, is limited to cases involving the penalty of death. In Woodson v. North Carolina, at pp. 303-305, Stewart J., delivering the opinion of the plurality of the United States Supreme Court, said:

In Furman [Furman v. Georgia 408 US 238 (1972)] members of the Court acknowledged what cannot fairly be denied – that death is a punishment different from all other sanctions in kind rather than degree. See 408 US, at 286-291, 33 L Ed 2d 346, 92 S Ct 2726 (Brennan, J., concurring); id., at 306, 33 L Ed 2d 346, 92 S Ct 2726 (Stewart, J., concurring). A process that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind. It treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death.

This Court has previously recognized that “[f]or the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.” Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v Ashe, 302 US 51, 55, 82 L Ed 43, 58 S Ct 59 (1937). Consideration of both the offender and the offense in order to arrive at a just and appropriate sentence has been viewed as a progressive and humanizing development. See Williams v New York, 337 US, at 247-249, 93 L Ed 1337, 69 S Ct 1079; Furman v Georgia, 408 US, at 402-403, 33 L Ed 2d 346, 92 S Ct 2726 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). While the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative, we believe that in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment, see Trop v Dulles, 356 US, at 100, 2 L Ed 2d 630, 78 S Ct 590 (plurality opinion), requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.

This conclusion rests squarely on the predicate that the penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however long. Death, in its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one of only a year or two. Because of that qualitative difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.

[113]                  The short statement in the passage just quoted that the “practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative” does not appear to be stated in any of the other leading cases cited that involved the death penalty. Nonetheless, it remains a clear statement by the United States Supreme Court that, even if it may be an “enlightened policy”, it is not dictated as a constitutional imperative by the Eighth Amendment in cases other than ones where the death penalty is mandated by statute.

[114]                  Other decisions of the United States Supreme Court impose the constitutional imperative that in capital cases the sentencing authority consider mitigating circumstances in order to give meaning to the individualized sentencing requirement, whether those mitigating circumstances are found in any aspect of an accused’s character or record or in any of the circumstances of the offence. See Sumner v. Shuman at pp. 65-66, referring to Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973, 98 S. Ct. 2954 (1978), Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1, 102 S. Ct. 869 (1982), and Hitchcock v. Dugger, 95 L. Ed. 2d 347, 107 S. Ct. 1821 (1987). In Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633, the Supreme Court struck down a state statute that required imposition of the death penalty for the first degree murder of a police officer engaged in the performance of his lawful duties because the statute allowed for no consideration of particular mitigating factors in deciding whether the death sentence should be imposed. The majority opinion of the court has already been quoted from.

[115]                  I have reviewed the constitutional status of individualized sentencing in the United States to demonstrate that in that country the courts have not held that individualized sentencing is required as a constitutional imperative except in capital cases. It is true that the context of those decisions has been the Eighth Amendment, and we are here considering the very different provisions of s. 7 of the Charter. Nonetheless, this review has shown that Roberts v. Louisiana, 49 L. Ed. (2d) 974, cannot be relied upon to support a general statement that individualized sentencing is a principle of fundamental justice.

[116]                  Mr. O’Brien cites also the following observation by the distinguished scholar, Professor Norval Morris, in a paper entitled “Sentencing and Parole” (1977), 51 Aus. LJ. 523, at p. 529:

MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

This is the most extreme form of legislative limitation of judicial discretion – a fixed term or a fixed minimum term for a defined crime. A popular example is the minimum of a five-year sentence for anyone carrying a gun at the time of the commission of a felony. Legislation of this kind is unprincipled and morally insensible; it cannot encompass the factual and moral distinctions between crimes essential to a just and rational sentencing policy …

LEGISLATIVELY FIXED TERM SENTENCES

It is impossible for legislatures to define in advance, certainly in relation to the existing definitions of crimes, sentences that are just and appropriate. The best they can possibly do is to phrase the range from the least socially tolerable sanction to the maximum deserved punishment Legislatively fixed terms preclude that fine tuning of punishment to relate it to the severity of the offence and the moral gravity of the crime which is of the essence of justice and which can be achieved only by the judge.

[117]                  However valid those observations may be as to what should be the approach of a rational sentencing policy, his remarks fall far short of being support for the proposition that the legislature may not exclude individualized sentencing for a particular offence, as a matter of fundamental justice.

[118]                  Reference was made by Mr. O’Brien to the report of the Canadian Sentencing Commission (1987), entitled Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach. It recommended the abolition of mandatory minimum penalties for all offences except murder and high treason (Rec. 8.1). Its view, which in its recommendations it applied to all offences except murder and high treason, was that, as stated at p. 186, “each criminal offence is uniquely defined by its own set of circumstances and the notion of a judge pre-determining a sentence before hearing the facts seems abhorrent to our notion of justice”. There may be some inconsistency between that statement of principle and the commission’s recommendations as to murder and high treason. In regard to first degree murder and high treason, the commission recommended that persons convicted of those crimes “be eligible for release on conditions after serving a minimum of 15 years up to a maximum of 25 years in custody”, the date of eligibility for release within that limit being set by the court (Rec. 10.17). This would compare with a second degree murderer’s eligibility for “release on conditions” (which would be like present-day parole) after serving a minimum of 10 years, up to a maximum of 15 years in custody, once again the court setting the date of eligibility for release within that limit (Rec. 10.18). These changes must be read in the context of other major recommendations that would abolish full parole in regard to all sentences other than life imprisonment, replace mandatory supervision after two thirds of a sentence with earned remission after at least three quarters of the sentence is served, and generally, except for murder and high treason, abolish all maximum life sentence penalties and provide for a penalty structure with a ceiling of 12 years (Rec. 9.1) with a power resting in the court to impose an exceptional sentence up to 50 per cent higher than the maximum sentence for a specified offence. Whatever the merits of these proposals, it will be seen that in cases of murder, the sentencing commission’s proposals, if adopted, would retain a mandatory life sentence for first degree murder with a minimum of 15 years without eligibility for parole. Nothing in the commission’s report can provide support for Mr. O’Brien’s reference to it as if it condemned the application of a minimum period of ineligibility for parole for first degree murder.

[119]                  To return to the passage upon which Mr. O’Brien relies from the judgment of La Forest J. in R. v. Lyons, it cannot be said that that passage is authority for the proposition that Parliament, in weighing “the respective importance of prevention, retribution and rehabilitation”, is constitutionally precluded, as a matter of fundamental justice, from preventing the sentencing court from considering the details of the circumstances of the offence or of the circumstances of the offender, when Parliament decides that a particular offence in all circumstances deserves a particular fixed sentence.

[120]                  As for the first purported principle of “fundamental justice” proposed by Mr. O’Brien, I conclude that it is not supported by authority. I shall pass further observations about it on the plane of principle after a brief consideration of the second purported principle of “fundamental justice” proposed by Mr. O’Brien. To repeat, he argues that fundamental justice demands that “the sentence be based upon the moral blameworthiness of the offender in order that the ‘punishment fit the crime’ ”.

[121]                  To support this proposal, he refers to the emphasis that is placed by the substantive criminal law in the determination of guilt and the determination of the fitness of a sentence, upon moral culpability or moral blameworthiness. Thus, he observes, in R. v. Droste (1984), 1984 CanLII 68 (SCC), 39 C.R. (3d) 26, 10 C.C.C. (3d) 404, 6 D.L.R. (4th) 607, 3 O.A.C. 179, 52 N.R. 176, Dickson J. of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated at p. 415, in regard to first degree murder that is “planned and deliberate”, that:

The rationale behind s. 214(2) is that there is an added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and deliberate which justifies a harsher sentence.

[122]                  Mr. O’Brien cites also the following passage from the judgment of Wilson J. in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, [1986] 1 W.W.R. 481 (sub nom. Ref. re S. 94(2) of Motor Vehicle Act), 69 B.C.L.R. 145, 48 C.R. (3d) 289, 36 M.V.R. 240, 23 C.C.C. (3d) 284 at 325, 24 D.L.R.(4th) 536, 18 C.R.R. 30, 63 N.R. 266:

It is basic to any theory of punishment that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a “fit” sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender “deserved” the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system. This is not to say that there is an inherently appropriate relationship between a particular offence and its punishment but rather that there is a scale of offences and punishments into which the particular offence and punishment must fit Obviously, this cannot be done with mathematical precision and many different factors will go into the assessment of the seriousness of a particular offence for purposes of determining the appropriate punishment but it does provide a workable conventional framework for sentencing. Indeed, judges in the exercise of their sentencing discretion have been employing such a scale for over 100 years.

In that case, Wilson J. held that a mandatory term of imprisonment for an offence committed unknowingly and unwittingly and after the exercise of due diligence [p. 325] “offends the principles of fundamental justice embodied in our penal system” and in s. 7 of the Charter. Her reasons were that a mandatory term of imprisonment where liability is absolute “is grossly excessive and inhumane”, that it “is not required to reduce the incidence of the offence”, that it “is beyond anything required to satisfy the need for ‘atonement’ ”, and that “society … would not find abhorrent an unintentional and unknowing violation of the section”. The section in question created the offence of driving a motor vehicle while the driver is prohibited from driving or while his driver’s licence is suspended, punishable by a mandatory fine and imprisonment for not less than seven days and not more than six months.

[123]                  In the present case it is necessary to decide whether the mandatory imposition of a term of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years offends the characteristics which Wilson J. described as “basic to any theory of punishment”. From her use of that phrase I think it can be inferred that those characteristics are to be regarded as, using the words of Lamer J. at p. 310 of the Reference.

… a principle of fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7 …

which rests:

… upon an analysis of the nature, sources, rationale and essential role of that principle within the judicial process and in our legal system, as it evolves.

[124]                  In the Reference, Wilson J. at p. 324 listed the following as the five main objectives of a penal system (citing Nigel Walker, Sentencing in a Rational Society (1969)):

(1) to protect offenders and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation;

(2) to reduce the incidence of crime;

(3) to ensure that offenders atone for their offences;

(4) to keep punishment to the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives of the system, and

(5) to express society’s abhorrence of crime.

[125]                  She also cited Working Paper 11 of the Law Reform Commission of Canada, entitled “Imprisonment and Release” (Studies on Imprisonment, 1976), at p. 10, as follows:

Justice requires that the sanction of imprisonment not be disproportionate to the offence, and humanity dictates that it must not be heavier than necessary to achieve its objective.

[126]                  Wilson J.’s judgment in the Reference was written in 1985. In 1987 the report of the Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach, recommended the abolition of mandatory minimum penalties for all offences except murder and high treason.

[127]                  In the Reference, Wilson J. observed at p. 324 that:

While the Legislature may as a matter of government policy make this an offence, and we cannot question its wisdom in this regard, the question is whether it can make it mandatory for the courts to deprive a person convicted of it of his liberty without violating s. 7.

[128]                  On the facts of the Reference, Wilson J. held that “attaching a mandatory term of imprisonment to an absolute liability offence such as this violates the principles of fundamental justice”. That “the conscience of the court would be shocked and the administration of justice brought into disrepute by such an unreasonable and extravagant penalty”, and that the penalty was “totally disproportionate to the offence and quite incompatible with the objectives of a penal system referred to in para. (4) above”, i.e., “to keep punishment to the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives of the system”.

[129]                  It will be observed that nothing in the passages quoted from Wilson J.’s judgment in the Reference suggests that the legislature may not, as a matter of policy, prescribe a mandatory fixed penalty for an offence, although of course if it does so the question remains whether the legislature can make it mandatory for the courts to deprive a person convicted of it of his liberty – or of his liberty for a fixed period of time or for a fixed minimum period of time – without violating s. 7.

[130]                  I think that the legislature may, as a matter of policy, and subject to constitutional boundaries that are imposed by ss. 12 and 7, prescribe a mandatory fixed or minimum sentence for a particular offence, or for a particular offence which possesses a certain added feature, just as much as it may, as a matter of policy, decide what conduct amounts to a criminal offence, subject to the constitutional boundaries imposed by ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter.
