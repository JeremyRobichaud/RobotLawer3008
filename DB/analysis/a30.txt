5              It is not necessary to go at any length at all into the circumstances of the offender, save to say that the young man is now 16 years old.  He obviously had an unhappy and disrupted home life.  He has a serious drug or alcohol dependency and at the time he had a record for various offences which went back some 2 years.

 

6              At the time of the sentencing there was a fact which the learned judge, for some reason, was not apprised of, namely, that on the 23rd of September, 1993, this young man was sentenced to 6 months in custody arising from an offence which happened, I believe, on the 21st of May, 1993, that is to say three days prior to the offences in question.

 

7              The Young Offenders Act contains certain provisions relating to what might be called the maximum disposition.  It is clear, by the definition section, that the word 'disposition' in s.20 includes both a custodial sentence and probation.  The relevant subsections for our purposes are subsection 1(k) and subsections (3) and (4).  The combined effect of those sections is, for our purposes, that the sentences imposed here, on the first two counts to which I referred, are illegal because when one puts together the custodial provisions with the probation both exceed 3 years.  The second also is in error because it exceeds 2 years under subsection (k), it having been for an offence to which a sentence of life imprisonment does not apply.  Therefore, were it not for the earlier sentence of 6 months the maximum legal sentence which the sentencing judge here could have imposed was 3 years secure custody on the first count and 2 years secure custody on the second to run concurrently, or some combination of custody and probation not to exceed, respectively, 3 years and 2 years.

 

8              In my opinion, the effect of the sentence imposed on the 23rd of September is to make even 3 years here an unlawful sentence.  The maximum legal sentence he could impose was 3 years less the number of days from the 23rd of September to the 30th of November.

 

9              Counsel for the applicant has suggested to us that such a sentence is harsh and excessive.  What the learned judge said at the end of his reasons was this:

     Mr. Traviss also has an extensive record.  His record begins in April of 1991 with a break, enter and theft and an assault causing bodily harm, for which he received two years probation with conditions.  The assault causing bodily harm apparently was when he punched his mother in the nose, causing her nose to break.

     In October of the same year he was convicted of theft under a thousand dollars, for which he was given eighteen months probation with conditions.

     In January of 1992 he failed to comply with one part of that disposition and received sixty days open custody.

     In August of 1992 he was convicted of failing to comply with a disposition, three counts, and failing to comply with a recognizance, for which he received fifty-one days secure custody.

     That same month there was a fail (sic) to comply with a disposition for which he received twenty-one days custody.

     In February of 1993 he was convicted of two counts of break, enter and theft and forcible entry, for which he received a sentence of six months open custody.  He was in the process of serving that sentence and, remarkably, on temporary absence from that sentence when these offences were committed.

     Throughout the reports one theme emerges and that is the theme that each of these individuals are a high risk for re-offending.  That point is made over and over again by the various professionals who have authored these reports.

 

 

Later he said, having decided not to accept the joint submission of counsel as to what the sentence ought to be:

     If I were to impose a sentence that I did not feel comfortable with, then if that sentence was wrong from the point of view of society, there is little that could be done.  The Crown, having acceded to the submission, would not really have any position to take with respect to any kind of appeal.  Defence obviously would be in the same position.

     If I am wrong with respect to a higher sentence, there are provisions in the Young Offenders Act whereby my sentence can be reviewed, either through an appeal court or through the annual reviews which are taken pursuant to section 28 of the Young Offenders Act or pursuant to reviews upon application.

     In my view, a sentence of two years in this case is not sufficient.  This is a very serious crime.  This crime attacked two elderly people in their residence for no reason other than somebody wanting to take their car.  They were attacked with weapons while they were laying in their bed and they had no ability to defend themselves.  In addition, there was some planning, in anticipation of this attack, to disconnect the phone, so that they would have either no ability or very limited ability to call for help or to report the offence.  They were left without care for their condition or their welfare.  Their car, as I say, was taken.

     While there is some evidence that these two young men were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both, that cannot interfere with the ultimate effect of this offence, which, to me, is a very serious offence and deserving of serious denunciation.
