II.        The Evidence



[2]               The complainant and the accused were married in September 2005 shortly after he returned to Calgary from a two-year Church mission in Korea. The complainant testified that their sexual relations were consensual until September 2006. Sometime during that month, while they were living in Calgary, they were in bed naked. She had her back to him and was looking at the wall. He came up behind her trying to touch her breasts and to initiate sexual activity. She acknowledged in cross-examination that touching her breasts was a way he quite often instigated sexual intimacy with her. She told him “No, I don’t want to do this” or “No, I can’t do this” or words to that effect. He put his penis between her legs and used his hand to push his penis into her vagina. He continued to thrust until he had an orgasm then rolled over away from her. She was surprised that this was happening. She proceeded to take a bath; her vagina hurt when she tried to enter the water.



[3]               She recalled on another occasion it was dark; they were in bed naked.  He came up behind her. She expressed “I don’t want to do this, let’s not do this”, however, he had sexual intercourse with her while she cried and he heard her crying.



[4]               They lived in Edmonton from April 2007 to April 2008. She recalled one occasion during the daytime when again she told him  “No, I don’t want to have sex with you”. He came up behind her and pushed his penis into her vagina. She was looking out the window and crying while he had sexual intercourse with her and thought “this is not what’s supposed to happen”.



[5]               The complainant described another incident when they were in bed naked. She was lying on her back and he was on top of her. She expressed that she did not want to have sex with him but could not recall her exact words. He proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. She pulled a pillow over her head so she did not have to look at him. She recalled more than once pulling a pillow over her face so she did not have to look at him and that one of these incidents occurred while they were living in Edmonton.



[6]               She stated that all of these times she was describing she held still so he would know she was not participating or enjoying the sexual activity in any way.



[7]               The complainant stated that there were times close to September 2006 when after she had said “No” and he had come up behind her, he would nonchalantly say the next morning, “I’m sorry I raped you last night.” She did not know how to respond to this. She recalled on a few occasions during the time frame of the indictment when she had been sleeping in her underwear. She would feel wet all over her and it would be semen that had gotten on to her while she was sleeping.




[8]               The complainant testified that these incidents of non-consensual sexual intercourse continued for more than a year, although she had no specific memory of how many times nor the dates of the incidents stating “... it was an up and down, frequent, expected kind of thing”. There were months it happened five times and months it happened once or not at all. She recalled the last incident of non-consensual sexual intercourse occurring in March or April of 2008 while they were still living in Edmonton.



[9]               The complainant also described incidents of sexual contact when she said “I don’t want to do this but just go ahead, like just do what you got to do so we can go to sleep.” She testified that W.A.T. referred to this as “pity sex”. She acknowledged there were also occasions during the time frame of the indictment when they would have consensual sexual intercourse which on some occasions she initiated.



[10]           The complainant testified that the word “rape” was first used by W.A.T. in September 2006 when they were talking about their relationship. It was suggested to her in cross-examination that she told W.A.T. in the car on the way home from a discussion at her parents’ home about her parents’ sexual issues that she felt their relationship was like rape. She  recalled the conversation. She was “fairly positive” she hadn’t used the word “rape” but had told W.A.T. she felt like she was being used, like he didn’t care about her. She also testified that when their first child was a year old, the accused said to him “... you’re only here because I raped your mom.” She described W.A.T. as being proud of this.



[11]           The complainant recalled an occasion when they were attempting to determine how far along she was in her pregnancy and W.A.T. consulted the journal he kept. He had drawn calendars of a few months in the journal and said  “... you were ovulating in this - this week, and I raped you on that day. It says right here.” He said “[t]hat day I raped you and then you laid in bed. You went to sleep. That’s the day you got pregnant.” She noticed that he had written “rape” on the calendar in his journal on days he apparently had raped her, “good sex” on days the sex was consensual, and “pity sex” on days she said okay even though she did not want to have sex. She recalled seeing the word “rape” in his journal four or five times in one month. After they moved back to Calgary from Edmonton in early May, 2008, he told her he had burned the journal.



[12]           The complainant acknowledged that before the spring of 2008 she did not scream or yell at or push W.A.T. away from the bed when he had non-consensual sexual intercourse with her.

However, after they returned to Calgary in late April 2008 until she left W.A.T. in February 2009, when she did not want to have sex with him she would communicate this aggressively by screaming, kicking and swearing at him. She would  physically shake when he came up behind her and would start yelling and pushing him away. It made her sick and her body felt like it was on autopilot. He reacted by calling her “frigid” and a “useless bitch” but would not try to have sex with her. Sometimes he would leave and when he returned later, she would consent to having sex with him. She recalled that the last time they had consensual sex was in late December 2008 or early January 2009.




[13]           She testified that other aspects of their marital relationship worsened during this period and they fought a lot. They communicated by email on a couple of occasions as they could not have a conversation without a fight. She acknowledged sending W.A.T. an email on March 21, 2008 in which she stated she did not want a divorce, “... I want to love you. I want to raise our children together... I know that this marriage can work and that we can both be happy with it.” Her email made no specific mention of their sexual issues. She wrote that they were not happy because of her “bad (no) relationship with my Heavenly Father right now”; that she did not feel they respected each other; that he thought in many ways she was “useless”; that she did not respect how he acted in many situations and some of the choices that he made. Her email went on to state:



[...], you need to know that I really love you. I know it must be hard for

you to see it. Sometimes it is hard for me to see it. I get so wrapped up in

what I think isn’t right in our relationship, I forget what is good about it

.... I love that you are concerned for me. That you do everything in your

power to make sure that I am comfortable and happy....  It’s comforting to

know that you are always loving and supporting me. I really am sorry that

I haven’t given you the same comfort ..... There is no question in my mind

that I am the one who has been failing lately.... I am going to try and be

better for you and for [child’s name] and for me.  For me, because I want you. I want

to love and live with you and be happy... I love you [...].



[14]           In re-examination, the complainant stated  that they would often fight and their talks usually centered on sexual problems, sexual assault and her not wanting sex as much as he did. This time she wanted to focus in her email on different things to see if that would cause a change in their relationship. She referred to the Heavenly Father as she would pray that she would have a sex drive comparable to her husband’s so they would not have these problems anymore. In regards to her reference to mutual respect and W.A.T. calling her “useless”, she stated that he would have known this was a reference to what he would say to her about their sexual relations.



[15]           In February 2009 the complainant moved into her parents’ home and also arranged for she and W.A.T. to meet their bishop. She also spoke to Mr. Wallace Dudley, the stake president of the Church, and she and the accused met with a counselor whom the bishop had arranged for them to see at Latter Day Saints Family Services,  Ms. Deanna Crowfoot.



[16]           The complainant testified that at their meeting with Ms. Crowfoot, W.A.T. said they had  sexual issues and that she did not want to have sex with him. When Ms. Crowfoot asked why, he responded that it was because he had raped her.



[17]           She decided  to divorce W.A.T.  in March 2009. She stated that she complained to the police that same month as she felt like her children were in danger and she needed to do something to protect them. She also needed to let her husband know she was not going to cover for him or pretend everything was okay.




[18]           She recalled in cross-examination having spoken to W.A.T. on the morning of June 4, 2009 before his arrest that day about why she had gone to the police. She acknowledged saying to him “What was I supposed to do? You’re powerful. Your father is a lawyer. You have money. I need to protect the kids.”  When it was put to her that she told W.A.T. she had complained to the police because she did not want him to get custody of the kids, she responded that she was scared for her kids and “custody has something to do with that”. She was scared for him if he had full custody. She was scared for him and the kids if he had unsupervised visits “... and that was a big impact on me going to the police”.



[19]           She stated in re-examination that one of the reasons she complained to police was that she was scared for the safety of the children if he had unsupervised visits as he had made comments about the kids in a sexual way that scared her considering his actions toward her. However, in re-cross-examination she acknowledged that from the time she left the home with the children in early February 2009 to June 4, 2009 the accused was not restricted to supervised visits and he saw the children numerous times.



[20]           Ms. Crowfoot testified that she met the complainant and W.A.T. for marital counseling  on February 10, 2009.  W.A.T. was the person mainly speaking; he said he had been inappropriate in the marriage, had raped his wife and that their first child had been conceived through a rape. The complainant just sat there saying nothing and let him hold her hand.



[21]           Ms. Crowfoot stated in cross-examination that her original notes of this session were destroyed after she transcribed them onto her computer within a day of the meeting. The original notes were destroyed for security reasons, so that all information regarding counseling sessions held in the office was kept only on computer, access to which required a private access number. She acknowledged that the transcribed notes were a summary of what was discussed at the counseling session. While initially denying the suggestion that W.A.T. was “very nonchalant and casual” when talking to her about this rape, she adopted her testimony to that effect from the preliminary inquiry when it was put to her in cross-examination.




[22]           Mr. Wallace Dudley testified that as stake president of the Church of Latter Day Saints, he has the power to discipline members of the Church and to make decisions with respect to access of members to the Church and Church functions.  He asked W.A.T. and the complainant to come to his office in February 2009 shortly after meeting with the complainant and her mother, they having brought to his attention concerns about the accused’s behaviour. His initial purpose in meeting the couple was to resolve those concerns and to determine whether W.A.T.’s behaviour offended the rules of the Church governing membership. At the meeting, he referred to information he had been given by Ms. Crowfoot. W.A.T. agreed that he had been pressuring the complainant to have more sexual relations than she wished to have and that he had on occasion pursued sexual relations with her when he knew she did not wish this to occur. He recalled W.A.T. agreeing that on occasion she may have been asleep when he pursued sexual relations and that on occasion he pressed the issue of having sex beyond what he felt was right or appropriate.



[23]           Mr. Dudley stated that W.A.T. used the word “rape” loosely to describe two occasions, one fairly recently, and he thought W.A.T. used the word “rape” more generally as well. W.A.T. used “rape” in their second meeting in referring to times when he had to work hard to have sexual relations with her, when it did not feel consensual to him.



[24]           Mr. Dudley stated in cross-examination that he believed W.A.T.’s intent in using the word “rape” was that he tried hard to have sexual relations often.

[25]           Mr. Bryan Leavitt, a Latter Day Saints Family Services counselor to whom W.A.T. was referred by Ms. Crowfoot, testified that he had meetings with W.A.T., two of them on March 25th and  May 27, 2009.  W.A.T. indicated to him at the outset that he did not want to be there. Mr. Leavitt questioned him about his relationship with his wife and other matters. W.A.T.  told him it was time to be completely open regarding his inappropriate activity including the rape of his wife.



[26]           Mr. Leavitt testified that in his notes of their May 27th  meeting, he put the word “rape” in quotes as W.A.T. was using the word freely and  he wasn’t sure W.A.T. really understood what he was referring to, what it really implied. W.A.T. told him he wanted to have a sexual relationship with his wife and she said “No”, that he coaxed and cajoled and eventually she gave in and they had sexual activity. He denied forcing her legs apart.



[27]           Mr. Leavitt stated in cross-examination that the more W.A.T. discussed what happened, the less he was convinced W.A.T. was talking about rape in the classic sense. He stated in re-examination that W.A.T. was in that regard referring to one occasion he was worried about.



[28]           W.A.T.  testified in his defence.  He is 27 years of age, was a university student for part of the time period referred to in the indictment and also ran a small business.



[29]           W.A.T. testified that in September of 2006 he and the complainant had dinner at the home of her mother and stepfather. The complainant’s mother talked openly about feeling forced into having sexual intercourse with the complainant’s father. W.A.T. testified that during the drive home, the complainant said “You know, what happened to my mother, you know, basically I think that’s what you’re doing to me. I am receiving pressure to have sex. I am receiving – like you are wanting it. You are pushing it.” She paused then said “That’s rape.” He testified that he was completely surprised; the word “rape” had never been in his vocabulary. She then described it as “rape sex” and said that she thought he was just like her biological father. He responded that he was nothing like her father and that he did not agree with what she was saying.




[30]           He testified that he and the complainant engaged in what he described as three types of sex during the time frame of the indictment: “good sex”, a positive experience where both very much wanted the sexual activity. He could count on one hand the number of times they had “good sex” during the time frame of the indictment. Next he referred to “pity sex” to describe occasions he wanted sex and she did not but would say “all right or okay” verbally or non-verbally. There were also times when she approached him sexually and although he was exhausted he consented and they had sex. The “pity sex” occurred far more times when he was the one asking for it. He stated that the complainant has a terribly guilty conscience and would express that she felt like a bad wife, not giving her husband what he needed and would say “Okay let’s go ahead” and they would have sex.



[31]           He described the third type of sex they engaged in as  “rape sex” based on A.M.T.’s definition as occasions when she didn’t want sex at first. He would then work really hard, buy her flowers or a little surprise, run her bath, light candles and ask her again and she would consent. He knew she had changed her mind as she either said okay or it was mostly non-verbal body language in that she made herself available to his advances. Sometimes it took a day or a week to get to the point where she would agree to have sex. It was “pity sex” with “a whole lot of extra work”.



[32]           W.A.T.  also referred to occasions when the complainant did not want to have sex and communicated this verbally or non-verbally and they did not have sex. She used body language a lot; physically moving away, mumbling and groaning, putting a pillow between them. He confirmed the complainant’s testimony that after they returned to Calgary from Edmonton in the spring of 2008, she would scream or kick and they did not have sex, it being clear to him that she did not want it.



[33]           W.A.T. acknowledged having written “rape” in his private journal as alleged by the complainant. He described the journal as a way he could express himself and in which he wrote things that were very personal to him. He stated that just after their daughter was born in the fall of 2008 the complainant found the diary and was flipping through it. He acknowledged he had drawn a calendar in the journal and was tracking her ovulation as he wanted to have kids. He acknowledged having recorded on various dates in the journal “good sex”, “pity sex” and “rape” as he understood the terms.



[34]           According to W.A.T., the complainant always consented to their sexual activity either verbally or non-verbally to the best of his belief. He stated that there were occasions when he would be fondling her breasts or touching her body or verbally indicating he wanted to have sex; she didn’t say anything and just laid there. He said that physiologically while lying on her side her legs had to open up; if she didn’t move them sexual intercourse was not going to happen. After everything he could do to try and love her, she would make her vagina available to him then they would have sex. For him this was consensual sexual intercourse; although she didn’t say anything, she physically made herself available. He denied prying or forcing her legs open. He denied that they had sex when she had a pillow over her face.




[35]           W.A.T. acknowledged that the complainant arranged a meeting with their bishop in early February 2009 and the bishop in turn arranged for them to see Ms. Crowfoot. W.A.T. recalled that he did a lot of the talking at the beginning of their meeting while holding his wife’s hand. He stated that at one point the complainant said “he’s been raping me since the first day we got married” at which point he released her hand and sat back, shocked, not knowing what to say.  He recalled that the complainant advised Ms. Crowfoot that he had told their son he was the product of rape. He felt like he was being bullied in the meeting. Ms. Crowfoot told him the breakdown of the marriage was 100% his fault. She spoke about men who don’t work this out with their wives losing their lives, their family and their kids. He stated that her reference to his kids struck a chord with him and he agreed that he had been raping his wife. He was agreeing to what he understood it meant, namely “rape sex” where she didn’t want sex, he would work at it then she would consent. He acknowledged in cross-examination that he knew his wife and Ms. Crowfoot were not talking about that. He felt that if he agreed to what they were saying it would make the complainant happy and she would come home.



[36]           The complainant also informed him that Mr. Dudley wanted to see them. He knew that Mr. Dudley as stake president was the head of the Church disciplinary Council and had the power to excommunicate members. He was aware that they were meeting to discuss their marital and sexual issues.



[37]           He was shocked when Mr. Dudley asked him at their first meeting “ ... what should happen to a man in the church who holds the priesthood who is raping his wife?”  Mr. Dudley told him a disciplinary Council would be held and that in his opinion he should be excommunicated. He read a number of allegations from a sheet of paper and told W.A.T. he had to be honest and that lying was not a good idea. W.A.T. testified that he agreed to the list of allegations. He stated he did so as his membership in the Church was in question, something that mattered the most to him and he felt that if he did not agree he would be kicked out of the Church. He felt pressured to agree to everything Mr. Dudley said, that it was either give in or fight and if he fought he would lose his membership. He did what he was conditioned to do over the entire marriage, he gave in “... and hopefully it turns out good.”



[38]           W.A.T. recalled discussing with Mr. Dudley at a subsequent meeting two incidents of sexual intercourse that he felt “terribly guilty about”. It had been months since he and his wife had last had sex. He told her “I need a wife. I am working really hard. I need a wife. And I really need some intimacy. I could really use sex.” She consented on the spot and they had sexual intercourse, but he vividly remembered looking in her eyes and knowing she didn’t really want to be there. He stated that he felt terribly guilty about that. The second incident was basically the same but halfway through intercourse he pulled out and left. He stated that both incidents weighed in his conscience and were the only incidents he discussed with Mr. Dudley.



[39]           W.A.T. recalled meeting with Mr. Bryan Leavitt, however, he did not want to be there; Mr. Leavitt told him he reported to Mr. Dudley. Mr. Leavitt asked him about rape but he could not recall what he said in response. He knew his membership in the Church was at stake so he told him what they wanted to hear.




[40]           W.A.T. testified that he and the complainant shared the same bed on two occasions after the complainant left the home in February 2009. On the first occasion, she decided to stay the night rather than waken the kids who were sleeping at his home. He offered to sleep on the couch and she said he could sleep in the bed with her. He testified they slept in “spooning” positions in their underwear but that no sexual activity occurred. She left abruptly the next morning with the kids. He recalled a similar incident occurring on one other occasion.



[41]           W.A.T. confirmed that he had access to the children from the time they separated in February 2009 to his arrest on June 4, 2009. At that point, the terms of his release prevented him from having contact with the complainant and the children, however, his release terms were amended in October 2009 to allow him supervised visits with the children.
