Background (According to this Record)[1]

The Murder of Sean Simmons

[4]              At around 3:30 p.m. on October 3, 2000, Sean Simmons, age 31, was shot in the lobby of 12 Trinity Avenue, a small apartment building in Dartmouth.  He was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital with his condition deteriorating en route. He was pronounced dead at 11:27 p.m., approximately eight hours after the shooting.

[5]              On post-mortem examination, it was determined that Mr. Simmons had been shot twice - once in the right forearm and once in the head. No gunshot residue was found on the wounds but residue on Mr. Simmons' clothing suggested that he had been shot from close range - less than three feet.

[6]              Shortly after the gunshots, a witness heard the back door of the apartment building slam. Another witness, hearing the gunshots, looked out his bathroom window and saw a man "abruptly walking away" from 12 Trinity Avenue in the direction of nearby Spring Avenue. He saw this man mostly from behind and observed him to be wearing a jacket with a "panther" on the back and a baseball cap beneath which he wore a "fairly long" ponytail.

[7]              It was accepted by both parties at trial that the man seen leaving the building was Steven Gareau who wore a Hamilton Tiger Cats jacket and had a ponytail.  Gareau was also observed at the Speedy Muffler shop around the corner from 12 Trinity Avenue, wearing the jacket with the cat logo.  Gareau cut off his ponytail shortly after the homicide.

Relationship Between the Accused and Witnesses

[8]              Paul Derry and Tina Potts were a couple who, at the time of Mr. Simmons' murder, were partners in a life of crime. They each had a serious criminal record: Derry's included several fraud convictions, one of which led to a sentence of seven years in prison. Potts had already been convicted and imprisoned as an accessory to murder.

[9]              In 2000, they were living in Brockville, Ontario where Derry trafficked in speed, cocaine and heroin, and Ms. Potts performed frauds with bank cards. They also illegally possessed, and sometimes sold, firearms. They had three children.

[10]         In June, 2000, Derry and Potts came to Halifax for a vacation, accompanied by Gareau, a friend from Brockville.  During the vacation, they socialized with Wayne James, a relative of Derry's through marriage, and met Neil Smith, a member of the Hells Angels. Derry said that he also met Kelsie at some point during the vacation, though he could not recall the circumstances. Derry, James and Smith discussed plans for transporting guns and cocaine from Brockville to Halifax. The vacation lasted for about two weeks.

[11]         In late July or August, 2000, Potts and Derry moved their family to Halifax. The move reflected their desire to get away from Ontario. Again, they came with Gareau who drove a U-Haul vehicle while Derry and Potts travelled, separately, in their car. They were supporting themselves by bankcard frauds and had about $12,000 saved for the transition to Nova Scotia. Upon arrival, they moved into an apartment in Dartmouth at 31 Albro Lake Road.

[12]         Both Derry and Potts gave evidence about their relationship with Gareau. They had met him a few years earlier in Ontario. Gareau purchased drugs - mainly speed - from Derry and used it with Potts. He became good friends with both of them, though he was perhaps closer to Potts whom he would "check on" when Derry was away. Besides moving together and living together, they registered their apartment and car in Gareau's name and shared drugs with him while providing him some income as a trafficker. When Gareau was arrested shortly after the murder, Potts and Derry were both concerned that he receive personal and financial support in custody.

[13]         Derry and Potts brought firearms to Nova Scotia from Brockville, including the .32 calibre handgun used to shoot Mr. Simmons. Derry soon established himself as a partner of James in selling cocaine in Halifax. The two men obtained their supply of the drug, in powder form, from Neil Smith. It would then be cooked by Potts and James to form crack for sale to customers.

[14]         The cocaine was "fronted" by Smith to Derry and James. This meant they maintained a running debt to Smith which mounted over the fall of 2000. According to Derry, by the time of Mr. Simmons' murder, the debt was in the range of $80,000, which was making James "a little nervous". Derry said the debt was rising because James' "lifestyle was more than his income".

[15]         Gareau sometimes helped Derry and Potts with their continuing bankcard frauds. He also was given crack to sell but became addicted to the drug quite early in their time in Halifax. This led to his "acting really stupid" and eventually being asked to leave the apartment he shared with Derry and Potts.

[16]         According to Potts and Derry, Kelsie’s primary role in the drug enterprise was to stand guard with a gun, when the cooking of crack was taking place, either in the Albro Lake Road apartment or at Wayne James' apartment at Uniacke Square. Kelsie also delivered drugs for Wayne James and collected money. Only once did he traffic drugs at Derry's direction. Kelsie and Gareau became friends as well and smoked crack together.

The Direction to Kill Sean Simmons

[17]         Mr. Simmons, in the early 1990s, had been closely affiliated with the Halifax Hells Angels and hoped to become a member. By 1993, however, he was  targeted for violence by the club and was beaten up twice. The evidence suggested that this was the result of a belief among Hells Angels members that he had had an affair with the mistress of Michael McCrea, the then president of the Halifax chapter.

[18]         As a result, Mr. Simmons and his wife left Halifax and spent several years in New Brunswick, returning at the end of 1998. The defence contended that Simmons and the appellant were friends, eliciting from Simmons' wife that on one occasion Simmons was staying with the appellant when she delivered a suit to Simmons for a court appearance.

[19]         According to Derry, it was he who unwittingly drew the attention of the Hells Angels to the presence of Simmons in Halifax. In early September, 2000, he met Mr. Simmons, by chance, at 12 Trinity Avenue, in an apartment owned by someone else. They began to speak about people they knew in common from prison and then about the possibility that Mr. Simmons could sell quaaludes, of which Derry and James were then in possession. When Derry reported on this conversation to James, he was told to do nothing with Simmons until Simmons was cleared with the Hells Angels "clubhouse".

[20]         After consulting the clubhouse, James told Derry that Simmons was not "in good standing" and was "probably going to get hurt".  James told Derry to advise him when Simmons reappeared at the 12 Trinity Avenue apartment.

[21]         The report that Simmons was in Halifax led to a meeting among Derry, James and Neil Smith at the Corner Pocket bar. Upon being told that they knew where Simmons was hanging out, Smith "said he wanted him whacked and made a motion across his throat”. James said to Derry, "You heard him”. The Corner Pocket meeting took place a few weeks before the October 3 killing.

[22]         Derry asked Gareau to find Simmons at the Trinity Avenue apartment and report back on him. This effort to locate Simmons went on, according to Derry, "from the day I met him pretty much until the day he died”. Derry "left the onus" to locate Simmons on Gareau. Derry himself, however, also went to Trinity Avenue in search of Simmons.

[23]         In the period before October 3, 2000, Derry was in daily contact with Gareau about the effort to find Simmons. He was "pushing" Gareau to take more active measures to locate him in the days before the killing. Gareau began to make phone calls in an attempt to locate Simmons (who was, for a time, in hospital after a car accident). He made calls to Simmons' wife, Jylene, who testified that she was receiving very frequent calls from "Steve", including six to eight in the few days leading up to October 3.

[24]         In these calls, Gareau said he was looking for Simmons and asking where he was. He left messages saying that Simmons should call Derry about "some work to do or something”. Derry agreed that he had actively participated in setting Simmons up to be killed and that Gareau did the same; Gareau, Derry testified, was told that the purpose of hunting for Simmons was to kill him.  Gareau attended three to five meetings with Derry and James where this was discussed. He also agreed that the appellant was not, as far as he knew, aware of or involved in the effort to find and murder Simmons.

The Events of October 3, 2000

[25]         In the afternoon of October 3, Derry and Potts were at Uniacke Square following some bankcard frauds earlier in the day. They met with Wayne James and gave him his share of the fraud proceeds. While the three were together, Gareau telephoned Derry. He said that Simmons was in Dartmouth. Derry handed the phone to James who spoke to Gareau for a short time and then James went inside to get a gun. When he returned, the appellant was with him. The gun was a .32 calibre revolver that had belonged to Tina Potts and been lent by her to James sometime earlier when he needed it for an altercation at Uniacke Square.

[26]         The four people then entered Derry's Toyota Cressida and drove to Dartmouth. Derry was behind the wheel with James in the front passenger seat. The appellant was in the left rear seat and Potts was beside him.

[27]         Derry and Potts testified there was no conversation in the car on the way to Dartmouth about Simmons or the purpose of the trip. Once in Dartmouth, they drove past 12 Trinity Avenue where Derry said to James that it would be "crazy" for James, a six-foot black man, to commit the murder. He warned James "that he was going to be recognized and he probably shouldn't be doing it". This advice prompted James, according to Derry, to decide that the appellant should do the shooting. James passed the gun to Kelsie in the rear seat.

[28]         Derry claimed to be "kind of speechless" at this turn of events; he had thought that by persuading James not to commit the murder, he had ended the mission. Derry said James was "coaching" the appellant in words he cannot recall. He did not remember the appellant saying anything. Potts testified that when James passed the gun to the appellant and said, "You're going to have to do it then", the appellant agreed and asked Potts for gloves. She provided him latex gloves from a "streaking kit" and helped him put them on but they ripped. She also gave the appellant the green vest she was wearing, to keep up the hood on his hoodie.

[29]         The group drove to a muffler shop around the corner from 12 Trinity Avenue. There they met Gareau and spoke to him briefly. Derry testified that James gave twenty dollars to Gareau and instructed him to go with the appellant to 12 Trinity Avenue, leave through the back door after the murder, and then go to a bar called the Ship Victory to meet them later. Potts recalled that Gareau was wearing her football jacket with an emblem on its back which she never saw again after that day. Gareau asked for a drug "fix" but was refused by James.

[30]         After Gareau and the appellant headed toward 12 Trinity Avenue, with the appellant carrying the handgun, Derry drove the car a short distance up the street and parked near some bushes. Derry estimated that five minutes later the appellant ran back to the car and got in the rear seat. He was described as "excited", "anxious", "panicky", "out of breath" and "adrenaline-pumped". Derry gave evidence that Kelsie said, in response to a question from James, "I shot him three times", mentioning that one shot "creased his head like a watermelon". The appellant handed the gun to Potts who checked the cylinder and confirmed that it had been fired.

[31]         The group then drove to 31 Albro Lake Road. James proposed that Potts get rid of the gun by walking across a bridge and dropping it in the harbour but she refused. Derry and Potts then drove to Lawrencetown with the gun and the vest that Potts said the appellant had worn. They emptied the gun cylinder and placed dirt over it and threw the vest in the water.

[32]         From there, Potts and Derry drove back into Halifax and met Wayne James and the appellant at the Players Club. The two men had a "kit bag" containing some clothing, sneakers said to have been worn by the appellant, and a sawed-off shotgun. Derry and Potts drove with the kit bag to Beechville, picking up a bottle of fondue fluid along the way as an accelerant. They burned the clothing and attempted to burn the sneakers in Beechville, where they also disposed of the shotgun.

[33]         The next day, October 4, Derry acquired the distinctive football jacket from Gareau and disposed of it in a dumpster.  By this time, Gareau had cut off his ponytail. Later, the car used in the homicide was abandoned by Derry and Potts after it broke down in Amherst. The police eventually located and searched the car, finding in it, among other things, a newspaper from which a story about the killing of Simmons had been cut out.

[34]         After their cooperation with Derry and Potts began, the police were able to recover the .32 calibre handgun from the beach in Lawrencetown and burned clothing, including the sneakers, in Beechville.

[35]         Potts testified that she met the appellant in the period after the murder around Uniacke Square.  Potts said the appellant was upset because he had shot Simmons but James was "taking the credit for it". She found out from the appellant that he had known Simmons personally and that Simmons had had two children.

Arrests and Immunity

[36]         Gareau, who had been seen by a witness leaving 12 Trinity Avenue, was arrested by the police five days after the murder, while Derry and Potts were visiting Potts' family in Prince Edward Island. The police had seized guns from the Albro Lake Road apartment and, as a result, Potts and Derry lost custody of their children - though they had not yet been arrested. Derry decided that he would turn himself in to the police and did so on October 14, 2000. He gave the police a false statement and was released with only a weapons charge against him.

[37]         Derry related a complicated story about his dealings with the police. Because of his history of work as a police agent in Ontario, he had a "handler" in the RCMP in Ottawa named Mike Cabana. He said that he had spoken to Cabana in the week before the murder in an attempt to encourage an "operation" in which he would try to stop the murder and assist with the apprehension of those involved. Cabana had placed him in contact with two Halifax officers but as the murder drew closer they did not return his calls.

[38]         In late October when he reported on his bail for the weapons offences, Derry was arrested again, this time with Potts. They were both questioned and gave false information, and were then released without charges. A week later, an investigating officer on the case came to their apartment to speak with Derry. They began "building a relationship of trust" through November and December which led, on February 1, 2001, to a formal immunity agreement for Derry. Under this agreement, he would consent to interceptions of his private communications with suspects and to monitoring of his telephone. He was expected to maintain his criminal relationship with those involved and report to the police. In exchange, besides immunity, he received $500 weekly, a new apartment and eventual placement in the Witness Protection Program.

[39]         Potts eventually received immunity as well and gave what she said were truthful statements, though she was not engaged as a police agent. Both Derry and Potts said that they were motivated in part by the hope that they would be able to regain custody of their children through their work with the police.

[40]         While building their relationship with the police, Derry and Potts continued their work as drug dealers with James and Smith. This lasted until Christmas 2000 when, concerned about the mounting debt to Smith, Derry ended his partnership with James and began to work with another man; Bobby Milton. Derry described a meeting before Christmas at the Corner Pocket bar in which he told Neil Smith that James had not personally committed the murder of Simmons. Smith was upset by this since he had reduced the drug debt from James by $25,000.

[41]         Derry and Potts eventually moved in with Bobby Milton and, for a time, the appellant joined them. According to Derry, the appellant said that he had received 3/8 of an ounce of crack for shooting Simmons, though James had promised him $5000. Derry said that he and the appellant discussed the shooting of Simmons frequently until the appellant was arrested in March, 2001 on drug charges.

Surveillance and Interceptions

[42]         With Derry cooperating with the police, investigators began to surveil meetings among people in the Wayne James and Neil Smith circle.  On six dates between January 31 and April 6, 2001, officers observed a series of meetings involving, in different combinations, Paul Derry, Tina Potts, Wayne James, Neil Smith, Bobby Milton and other men.  The appellant was not seen at any of these meetings.

[43]         Derry gave evidence about three intercepted communications with the appellant, two telephone calls from jail and a third during a visit to the jail.

[44]         At trial, the Crown highlighted the following features of a call which occurred on March 2, 2001, between Derry at his apartment and the appellant in jail:

•                    The appellant confirmed to Derry that Gareau, also in jail, "still seemed kosher" and had had no visits.

•                    Derry suggested that he had heard the appellant had been speaking to a third man about the shooting. The appellant denied it.

•                    Derry said that he had reported to Neil Smith that "credit was given where credit wasn't deserved" (for the shooting, according to Derry) and the appellant replied "Yeah". When Derry asked "Who has the balls?" The appellant replied "You know”.

[45]         On March 5, 2001, Derry visited the appellant at the Halifax County Correctional Centre, wearing a body pack. At trial, the Crown emphasized the following passages from this conversation:

•                    When Derry asked if James had given the appellant anything, the appellant replied, "No”. Derry said that James "told me he gave you four ounces”, and the appellant replied, "He gave me two balls man… two, maybe three”.

•                    When Derry said, "But then he changed his mind. I don't think he had any intentions of it in the first place", the appellant replied, "I don't think he did either”. According to Derry, this was an exchange about James deciding not to shoot Simmons.

•                    When Derry said he would be going to see Neil Smith that day, the appellant responded, "Tell him what's up… he told me, man, you can have it all right now." Derry said this was a reference to the appellant’s role in the murder, and that he answered, "You could, though, because he knew you had the balls”.

•                    The appellant, in a low voice, described how he had demanded from Wayne James his payment of three 8-balls; he had said, "Give them to me”.

•                    The appellant raised the question of whether the shotgun and sneakers were burned in Beechville. Derry said they had been.

•                    Derry said to the appellant that "everything was burned", and testified that he meant the murder weapon. The appellant asked, "There's nothing, right?"

•                    In a discussion of Gareau, Derry suggested, "He's the only one that seen you" and the appellant answered, "I don't even think he did." The appellant said, "The first one went" and Derry replied, "Right after the first shot he was gone?" The appellant answered, "He left then. Chicken”.

[46]         Finally, the jury heard a March 6, 2001 telephone call:

•                    The appellant spoke disparagingly of Wayne James, saying he was "a piece of shit" and "bit the hand that fed him."

•                    In recounting a call he made to James, the appellant said, "I wasn't callin' for money… I wasn't callin' for no fucken…no… nothing for the hit or nothin'”.

•                    Referring to Neil Smith as "the source", the appellant said, "I'm sure the source will come to me when I get out”.

•                    In an exchange that Derry claimed was about the murder weapon, the appellant said, "It'd never feel the same in my hand as that did that night. That's like I married that motherfucker without you knowing".

The Appellant’s Statement to the Police

[47]         The investigation of Mr. Simmons’ murder culminated on April 17, 2001 with the arrests and detention of Wayne James, Neil Smith and the appellant. Gareau was already in jail on the murder charge.

[48]         The appellant was at Springhill Institution on the day of the arrests. When invited by the police to make a statement - he spoke at length. His statement confirmed the evidence of Derry and Potts that they had accompanied Wayne James and the appellant to Dartmouth, that James had handed him the gun, and that he had gone to 12 Trinity Avenue with Gareau. But he denied either shooting Simmons or intending to do so.   Kelsie said that when he told Gareau he couldn’t do it, Gareau took the gun from him and committed the murder inside the building. Gareau then returned the gun to the appellant who returned to the waiting vehicle.

[49]         The statement recounts what the appellant expected would happen as the car headed to 12 Trinity Avenue and what took place after their arrival:

S/Sgt. Mosher:             Okay, can you outline for myself and Constable LOMOND      ahhh….what happened on that day and how you ended up over at ahhh…. At ahhh….Trinity Avenue where Mr. SIMMONS was shot? What your roll (sic) would of been in that.

Mr. Kelsey (sic):          Ummm…I was told that someone needed to be taught a lesson, whatever. I thought someone was gonna get just, you know, get taught a lesson.  And Paul picked me up in his car ummm….drove me to a location….ummm….passed me a gun.  His pager went off and ahhh…. Mr. GAREAU comin' out….comes down the street.  I get outta the car with the gun you know, not with the intention to hurt anybody.  I just wanted to frighten somebody, you know.  Ummm…then I found out who the individual was.  Ummm…he was my friend.  So I….I back….I coward out, I couldn't do it….you know.  And ummm….the gun was taken from me.  Ummm….Mr. GAREAU went to the building.  I followed Mr. ...  Mr. SIMMONS, ya know, greeted me with a hug.  After we….after the embrace was over I turned and I heard shots fired. Ummm….Mr. GAREAU comes down beside me….(Sighs) ….I hear another shot and I'm….I was standing there.  He goes to pass….he goes….passes me the….the gun. I'm still in shock.  I….I don't know what just happened.  I'm coke induced, whatever.  I take the gun and I….I see him run, so I run.  The only place I had to run was back to the car where Paul was waiting for me.  Ummm….I give the….I give the gun to Tina and I go back down….and I went back to Halifax.

[50]         When questioned about the details of this account, the appellant said:

Mr. Kelsey:      I just….I just remembered they ummm….picked me up….and then drove over to Dartmouth and ummm….you know, s's'said whatever….the guy needed to be taught a lesson.  Ummm….that's about it.  They just drove me to the spot where Mr. GAREAU met me and then I….he said, yeah, some guy named SIMMONS? And I said the first (1st) name, I said, Sean….SIMMONS?

                        He's like….yeah.  And I'm like, I can't do this.  He's like, you know we gotta do this….that's what….you know.  And I said, I can't do it. And he just said, it's just another day.  I don't rem'….I went in after him, he took the….I said, I can't do it.  And he took the gun.  I didn't….I didn't go away because I was scared that maybe, you know, he'd put one (1) in me.  So I follow….I followed him.  Ummm….he went in first (1st). Sean open'….Sean had the door still open for me.  He recognized it was me.  He gave me a hug.  I turned to go up the stairs after Mr. GAREAU and I heard the shots.  As I went down back to the front door Mr. GAREAU came down by the front door.  I heard another shot and the gun was more or less tossed at me, like, it was more or less pressed on me and I was in shock. I….he ran.  He was the first (1st) one to run.  I will still standing there, like….just realized what happened and I just, you know.  I was scared and I ran.

[51]         The appellant said he was initially given the gun in the car by Derry and returned it to Potts after the shooting. With regard to his purpose in going to 12 Trinity Avenue, he told the officers:

S/Sgt. Mosher: When you got outta the car….



Mr. Kelsey:         Yeah.



S/Sgt. Mosher: ….and you and Mr. GAR….and you and Stephen GAREAU were walkin' toward the apartment building….did you have….were you carrying the gun then?



Mr. Kelsey:         Well, til we got….maybe ten (10) fifteen (15) feet from the building, that's when he took it from me.



S/Sgt. Mosher: And why did he take it from you?



Mr. Kelsey:         Cause I couldn't do it.  I said I couldn't do it.  He s'said we're in this together.



S/Sgt. Mosher: And what did you say?



Mr. Kelsey:         I said, I can't do it.



S/Sgt. Mosher: And what did he say?



Mr. Kelsey:         He just t'….just took the gun.  …



S/Sgt. Mosher: So you didn't know who they were going to….



Mr. Kelsey:         No sir.





S/Sgt. Mosher: ….to do anything with?  As far as you were concerned they were just goin' to either beat him up, tune him up, whatever ya….



Mr. Kelsey:         That's what….



S/Sgt. Mosher: ….whatever terminology you want to use.



Mr. Kelsey:         Learn the less….a lesson, that's all I figured, you know.



S/Sgt. Mosher: Did you know what they were goin' to teach him a lesson?



Mr. Kelsey:         No sir.



S/Sgt. Mosher: No one ever told you?

Mr. Kelsey:      No sir.

[52]         The jury trial took place over 30 days between October 11, 2002 and February 25, 2003.  The jury deliberated for five days before returning guilty verdicts on first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

[53]         Mr. Kelsie appealed his convictions, and after retaining counsel, filed an Amended Notice of Appeal on May 10, 2017.
