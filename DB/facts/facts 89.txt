[4]                           William Nichols and Janice Gamble had come to Calgary from Vancouver in a rented car with two other people: John Gamble, husband of Mrs. Gamble, and Tracie Perry, a young girl. John Gamble eventually took his life from an overdose of drugs during the events that followed the shooting of Detective Sergeant Harrison.

[5]                           The foursome was headed for Toronto. Its members were in a car rented by Nichols. They changed to another rented car in Penticton, and arrived in Calgary later that day. They spent the night in a motel.

[6]                           The next day, after some shopping, they drove to the rear of the Inglewood Credit Union in South-east Calgary, Nichols was the driver. They parked behind the building. The two men got out, and went into the Credit Union, using a hold-up note written on a large envelope. Hand guns were displayed to the teller. $1,631 was taken. It was about 3:00 p.m.

[7]                           The two girls did not go into the Credit Union. There was evidence that Janice Gamble was seen walking back and forth in front of the building.

[8]                           The four people then left in the car with Janice Gamble at the wheel, and the other girl beside her. The two men were in the back. Nichols was on the driver's side: Gamble on the passenger's. When the vehicle reached Memorial Drive it headed west towards downtown Calgary. When it was about 8/10 of a mile from the scene of the robbery, the car stopped so that Nichols could replace Mrs. Gamble as driver. Soon thereafter at least four other cars, which had been following not far behind, also stopped.

[9]                           The vehicle immediately to the rear of the hold-up car was an unmarked police car, equipped with a radio. The radio was partially defective because while messages could be heard, no transmissions could be made. The sole occupant of the police car was the victim, Detective Sergeant Harrison. Although in plain clothes, he was clearly acting in the course of his duties.

[10]                       An exchange of shots then took place between the two male occupants of the getaway vehicle, on the one hand, and the detective, on the other. All were outside their vehicles when the shots were fired. The policeman was hit, by a shot from Nichols' gun, and died a few hours later.

[11]                       Numerous witnesses testified as to the manner in which the so-called "shoot-out" occurred.

[12]                       It seems that Detective Sergeant Harrison got out of his car with his gun drawn, and ordered the occupants of the getaway car to get out of theirs. The two men got out first, Nichols on the driver's side, and Gamble on the passenger's side.

[13]                       Following the exchange of shots, the getaway car took off at high speed, with Nichols driving.

[14]                       The first stop was at a restaurant, where a married couple were taken as hostages, and money was stolen from the cash register. The group then got into a taxi, and continued to a service station. The taxi driver stopped to get gas, since he had become suspicious. When he refused to return to the taxi, Nichols relieved him of the keys.

[15]                       Nichols then drove the taxi, and, some distance further, a lady, Mrs. Diane Perry (not to be confused with Tracie Perry, Nichols' companion from Vancouver), was tricked into stopping her car. Mrs. Perry was taken hostage, and the four Vancouver people and the three hostages continued to a house not far away. There the occupants fled the house upon the arrival of the robbers and their hostages.

[16]                       Nichols and Gamble entered into negotiations with the police by telephone shortly after their arrival at the house about 4:10 p.m. That evening, the male restaurant keeper, Mr. Jivraj, was released in return for some Demerol.

[17]                       The next day, Saturday, at around 7:00 p.m., Mrs. Jivraj and Mrs. Diane Perry, the remaining hostages, were released, and left the house. They were followed shortly thereafter by Tracie Perry and Janice Gamble.

[18]                       The next day, Sunday, the police entered the home to find John Gamble dead and William Nichols unconscious.
