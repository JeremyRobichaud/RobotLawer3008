III.      Role of the Court and Submissions of Counsel
[15]           The sentence for second degree murder is life imprisonment: Criminal Code, s 745(d).

A.        Parole Ineligibility
[16]           It remains for this Court to set the minimum time before Mr. Beglau becomes eligible and may apply for parole. That term is to be not less than 10 years and not more than 25 years: Criminal Code, s 745(c). It should be noted that regardless of his parole eligibility, Mr. Beglau will always be subject to state supervision, having been sentenced to life imprisonment. This Court may address only eligibility for parole; that is, when Mr. Beglau will be entitled for the first time to apply for parole. The final decision regarding release under conditions is always to be made by the Parole Board of Canada.

[17]           It should also be acknowledged that nothing this Court can do as part of the sentencing process can explain or reverse the brutality and the senselessness of this murder, or erase the sad reality that Melanie Hunter was forever taken from the lives of those close to her, especially her adult children, Brianna and Corey.

[18]           The Crown seeks a period of ineligibility for parole of 15 years, although acknowledges that a fit and reasonable range would be between 12 and 15 years. Defence counsel urges this Court to set the period of ineligibility for parole somewhere between 10 and 12 years.

B.        Ancillary Orders
[19]           The Crown also seeks ancillary orders:

1.         prohibiting Mr. Beglau from possessing firearms, ammunition or explosive substances for life (Criminal Code, s 109);

2.         directing that he provide a sample of bodily substance sufficient for DNA analysis (Criminal Code, s 487.051);

3.         prohibiting him from communicating directly or indirectly with Brianna Beglau, Corey Beglau or Gerald Meyer (Criminal Code, s 743.21(1));

4.         directing that that Ms. Hunter's iPad and cell phone be provided to Corey Beglau; and

5.         all other objects and documents be forfeited to the Crown.

[20]           These ancillary orders are not contested by the defence, except they request that Mr. Beglau’s phone, computer and the personal property on his person at the time of his arrest be provided to his designated family members. Counsel agreed that specifics of forfeiture could be addressed by communication from counsel to the police.

C.        Parole Ineligibility - Legal Principles
[21]           The relevant factors to be considered when making a determination of parole ineligibility are set out in s 745.4 of the Criminal Code: “... the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission.”

[22]           In R v Ryan, 2015 ABCA 286, 607 AR 47, leave denied [2016] SCCA No 54, the Alberta Court of Appeal reinforced that in setting the period of parole ineligibility:

1.         the trial judge is not to take into account pre-sentence custody, as that is the purview of the Parole Board of Canada to be calculated after trial (para 23),

2.         the trial judge is not to take into account a plea that was not accepted by the Crown (paras 34 & 35),

3.         the trial judge is to consider the issue of dangerousness (para 40), and to properly take into account denunciation in calculating the period of parole ineligibility (para 43).

[23]           I take into account the provisions of the Criminal Code, ss 745 and 745.4, in determining whether I am entitled to substitute for the 10 years ineligibility, a number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole that would be fit in the circumstances. I take into account the broad scope of discretion and flexibility recommended by Picard JA in that case to account for “the potential for variation of facts, both aggravating and mitigating, within each area” (para 47).

[24]           I also take into account the categorization of Wakeling JA that a recommended period without the opportunity for parole should span 16 to 20 years where the accused had been the domestic partner of the victim, and the homicide was directly attributable to that relationship, but also that the mitigating factor of a guilty plea should account for a significant reduction. Wakeling JA proposes a reduction of 20% (paras 189 & 190). Using either theory of calculation, I have determined that I will arrive at the same result in my conclusions.

IV.      Values, Principles, Objectives, Concepts and Factors of Sentencing
[25]           In addition to considering the factors set out in Criminal Code s 745.4, the Court must consider generally applicable principles of sentencing under Criminal Code ss 718, 718.1, and 718.2 (R v Ryan at paras 14, 180 and 225).

[26]           It is clear that in arriving at a just, fair and reasonable determination, the Court must focus on the values, principles, objectives, concepts and factors at play (Watson, J.A., “Systematics in Sentencing: The Words of the Law”, January 25-27, 2017).

[27]           The fundamental purposes of sentencing are to protect society, contribute to respect for the rule of law, and maintain a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that denounce unlawful conduct, deter the offender, separate offenders from society where necessary, assist in rehabilitating offenders, provide reparations for harm done and to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders: Criminal Code, s 718.

[28]           It is clear that a determination must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (Criminal Code, s 718.1), must be authorized by law, be rational, in that it must not be arbitrary nor capricious, focus upon the individual before the Court and the autonomy and responsibility of that individual, demonstrate parity in that similar circumstances should attract similar decisions and must show restraint, such that the least severe determination that will serve these policy objectives should be imposed, including both utilitarian lenity and normative humanity (see Watson, J.A. above).

[29]           The Court is to keep in mind that any decision imposed should be similar to decisions imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (Criminal Code, s 718.2(b)). Additionally, the Court is to make a decision that is reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to the victim or to the community (Criminal Code, s 718.2 (e)) and, most importantly, that the punishment to be imposed on Mr. Beglau must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (Criminal Code, s 718.1).

[30]           Criminal Code s 718.2 indicates that in making a determination, the court is to take into consideration whether punishment should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence.

V.        Parole Ineligibility - Case Law
[31]           The leading case with respect to parole ineligibility is R v Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 SCR 227 at 242-243, 129 DLR (4th) 657. In that case, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that as a general rule the period of parole ineligibility should be 10 years, but the trial judge could determine that the offender should wait longer before his or her suitability for release is first assessed, based on codified criteria. The Court added that an extension of the period of ineligibility would not be unusual, although 10 years may well be the term imposed in median cases. The Court recognized there is a broad range of seriousness within the offence of second degree murder, reflecting varying degrees of moral culpability.

[32]           In R v Shropshire at 238-239, the Court determined that denunciation should be part of the analysis under the “nature of the offence”, and that future dangerousness should be part of the analysis of “character of the offender”. Deterrence is also a relevant concern, since a longer period of parole ineligibility can be expected to deter some persons from reoffending.

VI.      Character of the Offender and Future Dangerousness
[33]           Mr. Beglau was born in November 1956, is currently 60 years old and was 58 years old at the time of the murder. He was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan and had three siblings. He came to Edmonton when he was in Grade 9, completed his Grade 12, attended the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and became a journeyman welder. In the early 1990s he was found to be suffering from cancer and had to leave that position. He spent 10 years in sales and was laid off in 2009.

[34]           In October 2014, he had open heart surgery including a bypass and in November 2014 had an internal defibulator put in place.

[35]           Mr. Beglau has struggled with depression and began taking sleeping medications in December 2014. In the spring of 2015 he began to see a therapist to address issues of anger and anxiety post-surgery, relationship difficulties and sleep issues.

[36]           The Crown marked as Exhibit S-2 a copy of Mr. Beglau’s criminal record. It is both very old, and unconnected to the offences before this Court:

September 11, 1973:   Possession of a narcotic, for which he received nine months’ probation;

April 19, 1974:            Possession of narcotics for the purpose of trafficking, for which he received two years in jail and two years’ probation upon release; and

March 11, 1983:         Possession of a narcotic for which he received one day in jail, a $750 fine, and in default jail for 90 days.

[37]           Mr. Beglau advises that he has no memory of the events of September 22, 2015, although he does recall having taken six sleeping pills on that day. He says he maintains his love for Melanie Hunter and cannot explain why this terrible event happened. He maintains that through his own actions, he too has suffered the loss of his wife, children, home and reputation.

[38]           In the almost year and one-half that he has been in the Edmonton Remand Center, he has participated in programming, including through the John Howard Society and Norquest College. Neither defence counsel nor Crown counsel allege that he is dangerous, nor will be a danger to society when he eventually obtains parole and returns to the community.

[39]           Mr. Beglau spoke during the hearing and indicated that on the date in question he could not sleep, he took sleeping pills and the next thing he remembers he awakened in the hospital. He says he regrets what happened, wishes that he could change the events of that date, and says that he is sorry for what occurred.

VII.     The Nature of the Offence, Denunciation and Deterrence
[40]           Murder is one of the most heinous crimes in the Criminal Code and attracts the most serious denunciation and revulsion by society. Murder of a spouse, including while separated, is one of the most horrendous forms of murder. It destroys the institution of marriage, destroys relationships, destroys children and brings irreparable harm to the family, to the neighbourhood and to society. Nothing that this Court can do will address the anger, pain, loss and devastation that murder in a domestic situation causes. It breaches the fundamental principles of respect for life and respect for the rule of law. This Court must denounce murder, particularly with respect to domestic situations, express its revulsion for this crime, and take steps to deter others from taking the life of another human being. All of these matters have been taken into account in the Criminal Code in imposing a life sentence of imprisonment. They must also be taken into account in determining the period of ineligibility for parole.

VIII.   Circumstances Surrounding the Commission of the Offence
[41]           This offence, the murder of a spouse in the circumstances that we have before this Court, is particularly egregious. For perhaps a month before this murder, the behaviour of Mr. Beglau had escalated. As indicated above, he had sent text messages and made a telephone call to the new friend of Ms. Hunter. Ms. Hunter had phoned the RCMP and complained that Mr. Beglau had been coming over uninvited, harassing her, contacting her friends and family. The RCMP had advised Mr. Beglau to limit his communication with Ms. Hunter to email and advised him that he was not permitted to enter her house without permission.

[42]           On the day of the offence, Mr. Beglau drove from Edmonton to Sherwood Park to commit the offence. He parked his vehicle a considerable distance away from Ms. Hunter’s house and walked to her residence. He was wearing gloves. He entered Ms. Hunter’s house without permission. He entered her bedroom with a serrated knife in his hand. I make no comment as to whether that knife came from his residence or, from Ms. Hunter’s residence, or from a third location. The attack upon Ms. Hunter was particularly violent and vicious. Ms. Hunter suffered significant defensive injuries as she screamed and tried to ward off Mr. Beglau. Mr. Beglau inflicted numerous stab and slashing wounds upon Ms. Hunter and eventually cut her throat from ear to ear so deeply that he severed her right carotid artery and right jugular vein, injured her left jugular vein and penetrated her neck right down to her cervical spine. The police photographs of the fatal injuries show numerous severe injuries exhibiting great force.

IX.      Victim Impact Statements
[43]           The Court heard four victim impact statements from Brianna Beglau, Corey Beglau, Rhonda Hayes and Gerald Meyer. It is clear from each of these statements that Ms. Hunter was a caring person who loved her children, and children in general. She was very talented and artistic, and exhibited a zest for life. Her happiness was infectious and at the time of this offence she was putting her past behind her and moving forward.

[44]           As the day of the murder drew near and the actions of Mr. Beglau increased in severity, Brianna Beglau, age 27, became so stressed that she developed shingles. When she heard of the murder of her mother, she knew instantly that it had been committed by her father. She now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffers from depression, anger, and periods of crying and screaming. Her return to Edmonton after the murder from Australia was in her words “dreadful” and her “worst nightmare”. She continues to suffer from night terrors and dreads going to sleep. She dreams about the murder on a regular basis, wakes up in sweats and screaming. She has gained weight and suffers from anxiety attacks, sometimes resulting in physical vomiting. She continues in therapy and for a while became suicidal, actually planning a time and a place to kill herself. Her career as a teacher has become impacted significantly and she worries about how her brother Corey is coping.

[45]           Corey Beglau, age 24, recalls vividly being taken from his place of work by RCMP officers. He too has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and sees two therapists on a regular basis. He says he can barely sleep because of recurring nightmares and the images of entering his mother’s bedroom. The blood soaked floor and the bloody handprints on the wall, have been burned into his memory. He says the impact of this loss is “gut wrenching, heart breaking and mentally traumatizing”; that his mental state has been crippled and his emotions exhausted by this brutal event.

[46]           Rhonda Hayes last spoke to Ms. Hunter on the evening of her death. She said that Ms. Hunter had a career she enjoyed, a home of which she was proud, various circles of friends and activities that enriched her life. She said that Ms. Hunter’s children were doing well and that made her very happy. Upon hearing of the murder of Ms. Hunter, Ms. Hayes felt crushed and for the first year after that date totally gave up her hobbies and activities. She too has sought help for mental health issues stemming from this incident.

[47]           Gerald Meyer was exposed to the murder itself over Facetime. He heard the screaming and all of the sounds surrounding the murder. For a couple of weeks after the incident he was barely sleeping and drinking heavily. He sought counselling with a firefighter chaplain and still wakes up with Ms. Hunter’s screams in his head.
