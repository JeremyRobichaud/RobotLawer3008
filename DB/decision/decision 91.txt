VII. Conclusion

 

[14]            I find that neither the passage of time, nor the tradition of juries being true to their oath, nor the judge’s instructions, nor the statutory right of challenges of potential jurors, nor questioning and screening in the general cleansing process will act as adequate measures to preserve the fundamental safeguard of a fair trial by an impartial jury.

 

[15]            Taking into account the nature of the crime, the size of the community, the prejudicial pre-trial publicity, the widespread animosity that people may have towards the accused, the widespread sympathy for the victims, the revulsion in the community and the previous young offender trial, I conclude that the ends of justice require that the trial to be moved from Medicine Hat to Calgary.
