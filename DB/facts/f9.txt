The facts of the matter are not substantially in issue and can be briefly stated. On the night in question, the appellant, accompanied by his older brother Stephen and a third party drove together to the rural community of Kelly's

Cross, some ten miles from Charlottetown, with the common intention of breaking and entering for the purpose of robbing the parochial residence of the local clergyman. Entry to the house was gained through a ground floor window. At the time of entry, and to the knowledge of the other two, Stephen Laviolette got possession of a heavy metal pipe which was found about the premises. This he took with him. The three searched the ground floor area, and apparently found little of value. They then went up to the second floor, whereupon the clergyman awoke, emerged from his bedroom, and accosted the three invaders, at least one of whom, Stephen Laviolette, was known to him. He was beaten into submission by the use of the pipe and died on the scene from the wounds which were inflicted upon him. The three then fledâ€¢ the scene with but small booty.

Subsequently, Stephen Laviolette pleaded guilty to the charge of second degree murder and acknowledged that he was the assailant who wielded the murder weapon.

The accused was charged as a party under s.21. The third party has also been dealt with by the Court, in a separate trial, and his case is immaterial to these proceedings.
