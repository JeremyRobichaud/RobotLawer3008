Facts and Circumstances     

 

[2]               I have ordered the sealing of all pre-trial proceedings and associated materials, arguments, recordings and rulings and prohibited publication of any of those matters. That order was made pending argument and decision on the propriety of and authority for sealing and publication ban orders in this case.

 

[3]               As a result, it behooves me to minimize the description of the relevant facts and circumstances so as to limit any damage which might result from the breach of my order and publication of this decision.

 

[4]               The Crown’s case is that the Accused made a decision to become a serial killer, documented that decision, and embarked upon that role by luring and attempting to kill Mr. Tetreault. The Crown’s theory is that the Accused learned from his failure with Mr. Tetreault and refined his techniques, which he also documented. The Crown alleges that seven days after failing to kill Mr. Tetreault, the Accused lured and killed and disposed of Mr. Altinger. The Accused also documented those actions.

 

[5]               The theory of the Crown is supported by a number of features common to both the attempt on Mr. Tetreault’s life and the killing of Mr. Altinger. The Crown’s case is also supported by forensic evidence and written material obtained from the deleted files on a laptop computer found in Mr. Twitchell’s vehicle.
