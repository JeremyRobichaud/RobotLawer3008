We are all convinced of the sincere motivation of this appellant to rehabilitate himself. In fact he is already well underway in his programme. In the light of the bizarre mitigating circumstances related to us and his strong motivation we accede to his request and for the sentence of two years less one day imposed by the trial judge we substitute a suspended sentence of three years subject to the conditions of a probation order which will take effect immediately upon his release from the term now being served (conditions of probation and advice were then provided to the appellant).
