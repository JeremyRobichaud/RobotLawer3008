[21]           In R v Bedi, 2017 BCSC 292, the 21-year-old accused, who had been present at the assault which resulted in the later death of the victim, offended s. 240 by communicating to the murderer that the police were at the murderer’s residence and other information which permitted the murderer to know something of the progress of the police investigation, and by communicating to the murderer that the accused and the murderer should ensure their respective statements as to alibi were consistent and that they should assert control over information provided by a third party with relevant knowledge.  His involvement in the murder had no element of coercion.  He did not cooperate with the police investigation.  The accused had a criminal record and was sentenced after being found guilty at trial.  The offence occurred when the accused was involved in drug use.  By the time of his sentencing he had been successful in ending that involvement.  He was sentenced to 22 months imprisonment.

[22]           In Bedi, Justice Schultes provided an extensive review of the other relevant authorities where sentences covering a broad range were imposed.

[23]           In R v. Matheson, 2015 NSSC 42, the accused plead guilty.  He was asked by the murderer who lived in the next apartment to assist him in disposing of the body of victim.  The 49-year-old accused initially refused to help, but after repeated requests he agreed.  His role was limited to driving the vehicle in which the murderer had put the body.  The accused was coerced to some degree by fear of the murderer.  He cooperated with police.  He was remorseful.  He had a criminal record.  Counsel jointly proposed and the court imposed a sentence of 3½ years.

[24]           In R v. Darby 2016 ABQB 352 the accused was a member of a Calgary street gang.  The 25-year-old accused plead guilty to conspiracy to murder one member of a rival gang and to being an accessory after the fact to the murders of three people: two members of a rival gang and an innocent bystander.  The accused had rented the car that the murderers used in connection with the murders.  The car was returned to him after the murders.  He knew that the car had been used in the murders.  He cleaned it in an effort to remove all trace evidence and returned it to the rental agency.  A positive psychological assessment for the accused was before the Court.  It was aggravating that he was a member of a criminal organization.

[25]           Tilleman J. observed that the accused’s involvement in the murders to which he was an accessory was minimal.  He rented the car which the murders used to travel to and from the scene of the murders.  He cleaned it before returning it to the rental agency.  The vehicle had not been used to transport bodies.  There was no indication that the accused’s actions in cleaning the vehicle assisted the murderers by concealing the offence or allowing them to escape detection.  Tilleman J. referenced British Columbia authority (R v. Steadman 2008 BCSC 1613) in which Barrow J. after reviewing the authorities concluded:  “These cases disclose that a range of sentence for an offender whose involvement is significant and who is not subject to threats of serious harm is between 18 months at the low end and 5 years at the upper end.”  Tilleman J. imposed a sentence of 3 years for the accessory after the fact conviction which was to run consecutively to the sentence of 8 years he imposed for the conspiracy conviction.

[26]           Defence counsel cited R v. Posthumus 2017 ABQB 665 where the accused plead guilty to being an accessary after the fact of manslaughter.  She was sentenced on a joint submission to 90 days in custody, which was time served, and probation.  In my view, this case does not provide much assistance in the determination of a fit sentence for Mr. Corrigan.

[27]           Having considered the authorities cited and the submissions of Counsel, I have concluded that the following factors are of particular significance to the determination of Mr. Corrigan’s sentence:

-         He, like the accused in Matheson and Darby, plead guilty.  This has significant mitigating effect.

-         By his guilty plea Mr. Corrigan has admitted that he drove Mr. Bown from the scene of the murder and disposed of the shell casing for the purpose of enabling Mr. Bown to escape.  He confirmed that he understood and intended his guilty plea to constitute an admission of this essential element of the offence in the s. 606 inquiry.  Whether either of the elements of the assistance actually assisted Mr. Bown to escape was not addressed in either the Agreed Statement of Facts or the submissions of Counsel.  Such information would be relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of Mr. Corrigan’s crime.  If Mr. Corrigan’s acts, though done for the purpose of assisting Mr. Bown to escape detection or arrest did not in fact assist him to do so, the offence would seem to me to be less serious than if they did assist an escape.  I was told nothing of the circumstances of Mr. Bown’s arrest.  I was not told whether Mr. Bown eluded arrest or whether Mr. Corrigan’s assisting actions interfered with the police determination that Mr. Bown was the murderer.  It is not obvious to me that driving Mr. Bown from the scene of the murder to the house (which must have been a drive of less than 10 minutes) and disposing of the shell casing would have constituted significant assistance to Mr. Bown.

-         By contrast to this lack of specificity as to how Mr. Corrigan’s conduct assisted Mr. Bown to escape detection or arrest, the Agreed Statement of Facts is very clear that on two occasions, once in July 2018 when Mr. Corrigan was arrested on another matter (presumably one of the robberies previously mentioned) and once after he returned from treatment for substance abuse, he voluntarily made full statements to police concerning the murder committed by Mr. Bown, cooperated in a re-enactment at the scene of the murder, and showed the police where he had disposed of the shell casing.  Although the extent to which his cooperation with police assisted them in the investigation of the murder is not clear, it seems reasonable to assume it was very helpful.  Indeed, the Agreed Statement of Facts says it constituted critical evidence in the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Bown. In my view, this mitigates the seriousness of Mr. Corrigan’s crime.

-         There was a significant element of coercion of Mr. Corrigan leading to his commission of this crime.  It is an agreed fact that he was concerned about Mr. Bown’s intentions when he learned of them in the course of the drive.  He was concerned that if he refused Mr. Bown’s requests that Mr. Bown would harm him.  Further, when Mr. Bown shot the firearm, he fired past Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Corrigan initially thought Mr. Bown was shooting towards him as well.  He drove Mr. Bown back to the house in this context – the context of actions on Mr. Bown’s part that were reasonably interpreted by Mr. Corrigan to present a continuing danger to himself.
