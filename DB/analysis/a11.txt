52]           Defence counsel submitted that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity. He referred to the complainant’s vague recollection of the events, her inability to recall the date and place of many of the incidents alleged or how many times they occurred over the time frame of the indictment. He noted that even within the time frame of the indictment, the complainant described several occasions when she and W.A.T. engaged in “pity sex”, a form of consensual sex, on some occasions at her instigation. Given her lack of specific memory of the occasions in question when she says non-consensual sex occurred as distinguished from these other occasions of consensual sexual activity, the Court should have concerns about the reliability and the credibility of her account that on some occasions she did not consent.  He noted that she was attempting to recall events occurring quite some time in the past as it was a full year after she alleges that the incidents of non-consensual sexual intercourse ended before she complained to the police.



[53]           Defence counsel also submitted that by virtue of giving an account of the incidents to her parents then repeating it to counselors, police authorities and at preliminary inquiry she has developed an honest belief that the events occurred which, as in the case of eyewitness evidence, is not necessarily reliable and that reasonable doubt should exist in that regard.




[54]           In reply, Crown counsel noted that the complainant had an accurate recollection of the first incident of non-consensual sexual intercourse, that it occurred in the bedroom, the month and year it occurred and what she was thinking at the time. While not specifically recalling when the subsequent incidents occurred, she was able to give some details about the incidents, for example, the time of day, what she said, or how she reacted. Crown counsel submitted that as a matter of common sense, someone who is regularly assaulted over a longer period of time will not recall exact dates and times. However, A.M.T. clearly differentiated between times she consented and times she did not when she said ‘no’ and W.A.T. had sexual intercourse with her anyway.



[55]           Crown counsel pointed out that W.A.T.’s testimony corroborated the complainant’s testimony in many respects; that he was pressuring her to have sex frequently, that he kept a journal in which he recorded “good sex”, “pity sex” and “rape”, that it was in the spring of 2008 that she started reacting aggressively to his sexual advances; that he admitted using the word “rape” in meetings with Ms. Crowfoot and Mr. Dudley.



[56]           W.A.T. testified that in his belief their sexual relations were consensual based on her body language that he became very familiar with over the time of their marriage; on most occasions of consensual sex she made herself available physically and did not say anything. He believed when she made herself available physically that she was consenting. However, what W.A.T. thought the complainant was thinking is irrelevant on the issue of whether the complainant’s state of mind was actually one of consent. The absence of consent is subjective and is solely determined by reference to the complainant’s subjective internal state of mind toward the touching at the time it occurred. I find that W.A.T.’s testimony about the conduct of the complainant before and during sexual intercourse does not raise a reasonable doubt  as to whether in her own mind she was consenting.



[57]           Turning to the complainant’s testimony, while as pointed out by defence counsel, the complainant could not recall with specificity the number of incidents of non-consensual sex that occurred in the period of the indictment, this is not in my view such as to raise reasonable doubt regarding the complainant’s internal state of mind in relation to consent, the incidents she referred to having occurred in the continuum of the marital relationship intermingled on her testimony with occasions of consensual sex, much of which was “pity sex” in the sense of her agreeing to having sex even though she did not want it. The fact that on an earlier or later occasion the complainant, in the context of the marital relationship, consented to sexual intercourse initially or changed her mind and agreed to have sex does not mean that on the occasions she described she was not consenting to having sex. The complainant testified that she experienced feelings of guilt and acceded to having sexual intercourse on some occasions in order to make the marriage work.



[58]           I do not find the complainant’s testimony that she did not want to have sex with W.A.T. on the occasions she mentioned was undermined by her email of March 2008 to W.A.T. in which she expressed her love for him and did not explicitly refer to their sexual issues. W.A.T. himself testified that she expressed a great deal of guilt about failing to fulfil her spousal role. She testified that at the time she wanted the marriage to continue and the family to remain together.




[59]           I find that the complainant’s acknowledgment that shortly after their separation she slept in the same bed with the accused while both of them were dressed in conservative underwear without sexual activity occurring does not undermine her testimony as to her internal state of mind during the earlier time frame of the indictment. By the spring of 2008 she was communicating her lack of consent in aggressive verbal and/or physical ways and W.A.T. never attempted to have sex with her against her will after that. She had no reason to believe otherwise when they slept in the same bed later on.



[60]           I do not find based on the number of times the complainant repeated the allegations that she came to honestly, but mistakenly, believe in her own lack of consent. She recalled in some detail her emotions while the incidents of non-consensual intercourse were occurring.



[61]           Finally, while she disclosed to W.A.T. on the day of his arrest and at trial that part of her motivation in complaining to police was to secure custody of the children, there is no suggestion in the evidence that this was her motivation when she first brought matters to the attention of her mother, her counselor and the Church in February. If custody and limiting W.A.T. to seeing their children on a supervised access basis was her primary goal in complaining to the police, one would have expected that she would have attempted to suspend or restrict his access while they were separated and before he was arrested, and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that she did so.



[62]           Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that it establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus of the offence of sexual assault and that the complainant’s internal state of mind was one of lack of consent on the occasions within the time frame of the indictment that she described in her testimony.



Mens rea and honest but mistaken belief in consent



[63]           The Crown must next prove beyond reasonable doubt the mens rea of the offence of sexual assault, namely, that W.A.T. knew that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual activity that is the subject of the indictment.



[64]           I find on the evidence that none of the factors in s. 265(3) apply to the circumstances here. Crown counsel conceded this to be the case.



[65]           I have already referred to s. 273.1(2). S. 265(4) states:

Accused’s belief as to consent

(4) Where an accused alleges that he believed that the complainant consented

to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that

there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence

relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider


the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.



[66]           S. 273.2 states:



Where belief in consent is not a defence

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under sections 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter

of the charge, where



(a)        the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i)         self-induced intoxication, or

(ii)        recklessness or wilful blindness; or



(b)        the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the

accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.



[67]           Consent in this context is considered from the perspective of the accused. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that W.A.T. knew, was reckless, or was wilfully blind to the fact that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual activity. A person is reckless when he or she knows that certain conduct may result in criminal harm but goes ahead and acts anyway. A person is wilfully blind when deliberately deciding not to inquire about something because he or she does not want to know the truth, or prefers to remain ignorant.



[68]           Continuing sexual contact after someone has said ‘no’ is, at a minimum, reckless conduct which fulfills the mens rea requirements of sexual assault. Major J. in Ewanchuk observed at para. 45, quoting from R v. Park, 1995 CanLII 104 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 39:



... the mens rea of sexual assault is not only satisfied when it is shown that

the accused knew that the complainant was essentially saying “no”, but

is also satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew the complainant

was essentially not saying “yes”.



[69]           Major J. continued at para. 46:



In order to cloak the accused’s actions in moral innocence, the evidence

must show that he believed that the complainant communicated consent

to engage in the sexual activity in question. A belief by the accused that

the complainant, in her own mind wanted him to touch her but did not

express that desire, is not a defence. The accused’s speculation as to what

was going on in the complainant’s mind provides no defence.

[italics in original]




[70]           What matters is whether W.A.T. believed the complainant said “yes” through her words and/or actions.  The question is not whether the complainant failed to communicate her lack of consent. The question is whether W.A.T. honestly believed that she had communicated her consent.



[71]           As noted in R. v. M.(M.L.) (1994), 1992 CanLII 4822 (NS SC), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 318 (S.C.C.), cited in Ewanchuk at para. 50, it would be an error to hold that the complainant is required to offer some minimal word or gesture of objection such that a lack of resistance could be equated with consent. To be morally innocent W.A.T. must show that he believed the complainant actually communicated her consent to engage in sexual activity. He cannot speculate as to what is going on in her mind. Once the complainant has expressed her unwillingness to engage in sexual contact, the accused should make certain that she has truly changed her mind before proceeding with further intimacies. He cannot rely on mere lapse of time or the complainant’s silence or equivocal conduct to indicate there has been a change of heart and that consent exists: Ewanchuk, at para. 52.



[72]           The determination of whether reasonable steps have been taken to ascertain whether a complainant is consenting to the sexual activity in question has both subjective and objective elements. The accused is obliged to take reasonable steps in the circumstances known to him to ascertain the complainant’s consent. More than a bare assertion as to honest but mistaken belief in consent is necessary even where a prior sexual relationship existed between the accused and the complainant: R v. B.(A.J.) (2007), 2007 MBCA 95 (CanLII), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 171 (Man.C.A.), at para. 52. Where the accused is relying on his prior sexual relationship with the complainant in advancing the mistaken belief defence, he must be able to articulate how the prior sexual history mistakenly led him to believe that the complainant was consenting at the time without engaging in the propensity reasoning I earlier referred to. The accused cannot transform his own acts into reflections of consent: R v. Cornejo (2003), 2003 CanLII 26893 (ON CA), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 206 (Ont.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 188 C.C.C. (3d) vi, at para. 32.



[73]           The accused’s belief in consent must be honest but it does not have to be reasonable. However, the Court must consider whether there were reasonable grounds for the accused’s belief. The presence or absence of reasonable grounds may help the trier of fact decide whether the accused’s belief was honest.



[74]           In determining whether the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent has an air of reality, the trial judge must consider the totality of the evidence and is required to assume that the evidence relied upon by the accused is true: R v. Cinnous, 2002 SCC 29 (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 53. At this threshold stage, the trial judge must determine if the evidence put forward is such that, if believed, a reasonable jury properly instructed could have acquitted: R v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 682.




[75]           W.A.T. described actions of the complainant in the form of body language and making her body physically available to him for sexual intercourse which he stated he took as clear signals that she was consenting. W.A.T.  testified that he did not pursue sexual activity when she said “no”. There were, however, occasions when she would change her mind and indicate verbally or more often through her body language that she was consenting which engendered a belief in him that she was consenting.  On the issue of reasonable steps, he referred to asking her questions such as “Are you okay with this?” “Can we have sex?”



[76]            The complainant stated that on each occasion when she said “no” to W.A.T.’s sexual advances, she would stay still and would not participate in the sexual activity that followed in relation to incidents in which she stated in her direct examination that sexual intercourse occurred without her consent. There is also evidence that W.A.T. described his sexual activity with the complainant in his journal, to two counselors and to a Church official as “rape” which would weigh against his assertion that he honestly believed that she was consenting to the sexual activity. However, it is not my function at the threshold stage to weigh the evidence, simply to determine whether the air of reality test has been met.



[77]           I find that there is evidence that the accused believed, acting honestly and without wilful blindness or recklessness, that the complainant was communicating her consent, evidence upon which, if believed, a reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit the accused. Crown counsel conceded that the defence was within the “outer bounds” of the air of reality test.



[78]           Having determined that there is an air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, there is no burden on W.A.T. to prove this defence. It is for the Crown to disprove honest but mistaken belief in consent beyond a reasonable doubt just as it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that W.A.T. knew that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual activity or was reckless or wilfully blind in that regard.



[79]           If I believe W.A.T’s testimony that he honestly believed that the complainant by her words or conduct communicated to him her consent to having sexual intercourse, then I must find him not guilty. Even if I do not believe W.A.T.’s testimony that he honestly believed that the complainant communicated to him her consent to having sexual intercourse, if his testimony leaves me with a reasonable doubt as to his honest but mistaken belief in her consent, then I must find him not guilty. Even if W.A.T.’s testimony does not leave me with a reasonable doubt as to his honest but mistaken belief in her consent, then I may convict him of the offence charged only if the rest of the evidence that I do accept proves his lack of honest belief that she communicated her consent to him beyond a reasonable doubt.




[80]           Defence counsel argued that W.A.T.’s honest but mistaken belief in the complainant’s consent arose from their inability to communicate effectively during their marriage. Both were  young and inexperienced in sexual relationships. The complainant was reluctant to talk about their problems and the situation continued to deteriorate to the point where she communicated her lack of consent through yelling and kicking. Defence counsel emphasized that when this occurred there were no more incidents of non-consensual sexual intercourse. At that point, it was made very clear to W.A.T.  that his wife was not communicating consent. However, they continued to have what she acknowledged to be consensual sex even after this point in their marriage. W.A.T. testified as to the steps he took in the context of “rape sex” to obtain her consent which were reasonable in the context of their ongoing marital relationship and the pattern of their sexual intimacy. He urged the Court to find that on the totality of the evidence there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused honestly but mistakenly believed in the complainant’s consent.



[81]           Defence counsel maintained that the entries in the journal kept by W.A.T. simply recorded his own interpretation of “rape sex” and were not referring to non-consensual sexual intercourse. He also submitted that admissions made by W.A.T. to Ms. Crowfoot, Mr. Dudley and Mr. Leavitt that he raped his wife must be considered in their context. W.A.T. was under tremendous pressure to say what they wanted to hear, the complainant having just left him with the children. W.A.T.  thought, naively, that if he admitted the accusations made by Mr. Dudley who had made it clear that he would use his power to excommunicate him, he might be able to retain membership in the Church and his wife would come home. He was aware that both Ms. Crowfoot and Mr. Leavitt were reporting back to Mr. Dudley.



[82]           Defence counsel pointed out that Mr. Leavitt intuitively suspected that W.A.T. was not in fact using the word “rape” in its classic sense but in the sense of continuing to pressure the complainant to have sex.



[83]           Defence counsel also pointed out that W.A.T. expressed shock when the complainant compared him to her father; he denied he was like him. He was also shocked that his wife told Ms. Crowfoot that he had raped her from “day one” in their marriage when he knew that this was not the case. Defence counsel referred to the complainant’s testimony that their sexual relations were frequent and consensual until September 2006, a full year after their marriage.



[84]           Finally, defence counsel pointed out that not one of the counselors seen by W.A.T.  nor Mr. Dudley took verbatim notes of what was said to them and by whom. Ms. Crowfoot destroyed her original notes and her summary of a 50 minute discussion was only a few lines long. He noted that while Mr. Dudley referred to W.A.T. having used  the word “rape” to describe an incident in December 2008, the complainant’s testimony was that the non-consensual sexual intercourse did not re-occur after they returned to Calgary in the spring of 2008. Mr. Dudley also referred to W.A.T. using the word “rape” to describe when he tried hard to have sexual relations often.




[85]           Crown counsel in response submitted that the complainant’s actions in aggressively expressing her lack of consent in the spring of 2008 were consistent with those of someone who “couldn’t take it anymore”, not someone who had a history of consensual sexual intercourse with her spouse. W.A.T. acknowledged he used the word “rape” to describe his actions to Ms. Crowfoot, Mr. Dudley and Mr. Leavitt. Crown counsel urged the Court to find that W.A.T.’s testimony that “ rape” meant to him something other than non-consensual sex was not credible. Why would he make the admission to Mr. Dudley of “rape” to preserve his membership in the Church ? According W.A.T.’s own testimony, at the outset of their first meeting, Mr. Dudley asked him what should happen to a man in the church who is holding the priesthood and raping his wife and communicating to W.A.T. his opinion that he should be excommunicated.  Why would he admit to having raped the complainant to Ms. Crowfoot knowing as he acknowledged in direct examination that what he was describing as consensual sex with a lot of effort, was not what the complainant and Ms. Crowfoot were talking about? Why would a university-educated person in his 20's use the word “rape” in his journal to describe something that was not rape?



[86]           I note that W.A.T. stated in cross examination that A.M.T. was the first woman he had sex with, that he was very innocent. He stated that he had never used the word “rape” before and that it always had a “really ugly connotation”. Yet he used the same word to describe something that was in the end consensual on his definition. In that regard, it is unclear from his testimony that he drew any real distinction in his mind between “pity sex” and “rape sex” as he defined both as involving  sex when she didn’t want it but consented; in the case of “rape sex” it simply took more effort on his part and longer to obtain her consent:



Rape sex, by the definition I understood, was there was an initial – there

was an initial, whether it was verbal “I’m not in the mood,” just like

pity sex or some non-verbal way of I don’t want to have sex. And then

there was this big long period that I had to do a lot to get to the point

where she would say “yes”, where she would consent.

[emphasis added]



[87]           Accordingly, I do not accept W.A.T.’s testimony that his reference to “rape” in his journal was a reference to consensual sex.  While the context of the admissions he made of rape to Mr. Dudley and Ms. Crowfoot which I will next review were situations in which he was under some pressure, there is no suggestion that the journal entries were recorded in circumstances of pressure or intimidation.  I find that W.A.T.’s own journal entries undermine his trial testimony that he did not know that the complainant was not consenting to sexual intercourse.


[88]           Mr. Dudley testified  that W.A.T. agreed that he had on occasion pursued sexual relations when he knew that the complainant did not wish for that to occur, that he agreed that on occasion she may have been asleep when he pursued sexual relations, and that on occasion he pressed the issue of having sex beyond what he felt was right or appropriate. He testified that W.A.T. used the term “rape” loosely to refer to incidents when he had sexual relations with her when she did not wish for him to pursue sexual relations. His notes recorded a concern expressed by the complainant about being pressured for sex by W.A.T.  While his notes were only a summary of their meeting, I do not find that his testimony was seriously undermined by that fact given they were made contemporaneously with their discussions at their second meeting. W.A.T.’s version of the two incidents he stated that he recounted in some detail to Mr. Dudley involved one that was very recent and another before that. In both cases what he was describing was his definition of ‘pity sex” as he was clear in his reference to the complainant having consented on the spot even though he knew she did not want to have sex. That was not on his own definition “rape sex” where she withheld consent then eventually changed her mind after “lots of work” on his part. I find that what he was being confronted with by Mr. Dudley and he understood was that he had sex with his wife without her consent. He admitted to Mr. Dudley that he had done so.



[89]           I find that by the time W.A.T. met with Mr. Leavitt the second time in May, 2009, he similarly deflected their discussion  to “pity sex”, although he initially admitted to Mr. Leavitt in their March 2009 meeting to having raped his wife.



[90]           Finally, while the accused testified that what he admitted to Ms. Crowfoot in February, 2009 was his own definition of “rape” that involved consensual sex on the one hand, he also stated that he had to agree that he was raping his wife, particularly when Ms. Crowfoot referred to men like him “that don’t work this out” losing their life, family and children.  Yet Ms. Crowfoot’s testimony was that he did most of the talking and told her he had raped his wife, not that he agreed to something she or the complainant said to him. Ms. Crowfoot stated that she transcribed her handwritten notes onto the computer in summary form within a day of recording them. While not verbatim, she recorded her notes contemporaneously with the event and it was not suggested that her notes contradicted her assertion that he told her he had raped his wife.



[91]           I also note that there was no suggestion in the testimony of Ms. Crowfoot or W.A.T. that  he explained to her what he meant by rape even though he knew, according to his direct testimony, that she and his wife were not talking about his definition of  “rape”. Despite this knowledge, he nonetheless agreed that he had raped his wife. I find that W.A.T. was aware at the initial meeting with Ms. Crowfoot that when she and the complainant were speaking of rape they were referring to non-consensual sexual intercourse.



[92]           I also find that W.A.T. was aware when he attended the initial meeting with Mr. Dudley that the latter was referring to non-consensual sexual intercourse when he questioned him. It is incongruous that W.A.T. would have assumed anything other than he was being accused of having non-consensual sex with his wife given the clear implications of Mr. Dudley’s opening comments that persons who raped their wives should be excommunicated from the Church. I find that W.A.T. was aware that by admitting he raped his wife he was admitting that he had non-consensual sex with her. It would be difficult to envisage that Mr. Dudley was contemplating  excommunication in a situation of consensual marital sex.



[93]           I find that W.A.T. knowingly admitted to both Mr. Dudley and Ms. Crowfoot that he had been having non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife.




[94]           I accept W.A.T.’s testimony that he felt pressure when he was being interviewed by Mr. Dudley, the stake president of the Church, and also when he met with Ms. Crowfoot and Mr. Leavitt who were both associated with the Church. However, I do not accept that he subjectively felt he was left completely without choices. He was urged to tell the truth by Mr. Dudley. The evidence of Ms. Crowfoot was that he came out with the admission of rape. He acknowledged in cross-examination that telling the truth was an important principle in the Church and that Church authority was important to him. However, when it was suggested that he had to listen to what the stake president and bishops say, he responded: “You have the choice in our church to listen if you want to. You don’t have to listen and you don’t have to follow. It’s a choice.” Accordingly, I find that subjectively W.A.T.’s assertion that he was in a box with no choices but to admit the accusations overstated his predicament.



[95]           Also undermining the credibility of W.A.T.’s denial at trial that he had non-consensual sexual intercourse with his wife were what I find to be his equivocal responses to Constable Daniels in his videotaped statement to her shortly after his arrest for sexual assault on June 4, 2009. When asked by her whether he had non-consensual sex with his wife he responded “I don’t think so, I don’t think so” and at another point “ I’m guessing when it was consensual it was rape.  And it was consensual pretty much every time.”



[96]           Defence counsel stated that W.A.T.’s somewhat unclear responses to Constable Daniels’ questioning should not be taken out of context. By that time, he was attempting to look back almost 2 ½ years after the first alleged incident and at least a year after the complainant had started aggressively demonstrating her lack of consent to him. However, he acknowledged at trial that when he made the last comment to Constable Daniels, what was going through his mind was that the complainant didn’t communicate with him, so he had to go through and think of every time they had rape sex (on his definition of the word).



[97]           While he may have been reflecting back on sexual activity that took place over a number of years, there was no suggestion in his testimony that he was unaware of his jeopardy when he made the statement to Constable Daniels. If he honestly believed that on the occasions they had sex it was with her consent as he asserted firmly at trial, why the less than firm responses at a time more proximate to the events? I find that his trial testimony is undermined by the somewhat equivocal responses he gave to Constable Daniels closer to the events.



[98]           Was W.A.T.’s professed belief in consent based on his own recklessness or wilful blindness?  As noted by Crown counsel, the complainant’s silence or ambiguous conduct is no defence. She submits that this at most was what was being communicated to W.A.T. and as such there can be no honest but mistaken belief in consent.



[99]           W.A.T. described touching his wife’s breasts as a frequent precursor in their marital relationship to consensual sexual intercourse. The complainant corroborated his testimony in that regard. He also referred to massaging her back and in the earlier stages of their relationship touching her vagina. There were times she communicated verbally or through her actions that she was not in the mood for sex. He testified that at times she would later say okay after he massaged her, leaving her sexual regions alone. He would then ask “Can I touch your breasts” or, in his words, she would make them available to him. She would say nothing in response to his questions “Are you okay with this? How are you doing? Does this feel good? Can I proceed? Like can we have sex?” Most of her communication that it was okay came through her body language in making herself available to him.




[100]      In the case of the occasions when he penetrated her vaginally from behind he stated that she would move her legs and position her hips to allow him to do so.



[101]      I do not believe W.A.T’s assertions that the complainant was by her conduct positively communicating her consent. Nor does his testimony raise a reasonable doubt that he honestly but mistakenly believed in her consent. On his own testimony she was silent despite his questioning, “Does this feel good?” “Can I proceed?” He acknowledged in his meetings with Mr. Dudley and Mr. Leavitt that he was pressuring her to have sex. He also knew that she did not want to have sex in the majority of their encounters as he stated that he could count on one hand the number of times they had good sex during the period of the indictment and that she initiated sexual contact very infrequently. He stated that he had to learn her body because she didn’t talk about what she liked and didn’t like; he had to learn her body language and “learn intimately what her body language meant”. He acknowledged however, that she was silent before and during the intercourse he characterized as “pity sex”. Similarly, he stated that with respect to the “rape sex”, her initial refusal would eventually be followed by consent through her body language. I refer to my earlier concerns regarding his credibility generally and also his acknowledgment that at one point in the spring of 2008 she started expressing her lack of consent in an aggressive fashion. I find in the context of their sexual relationship that the aggressive stance she adopted was consistent with a decision on her part that she would no longer permit him to ignore her passive lack of response to his unwanted advances which were preceded by her verbal refusals to have sex.



[102]      Looking at her aggressive response another way, if she was reacting aggressively to his sexual advances so as to make it clear to him she was not consenting, this is not what the law requires as it would be obliging her to express to him by her words or conduct the absence of consent. Any reasonable doubt as to honest but mistaken belief in consent must lie in her having communicated to him by her words or her conduct that she was saying “yes”, not that she wasn’t saying  “no”. If an accused acting honestly perceives his sexual partner’s conduct to be  ambiguous or unclear, he or she must abstain or obtain clarification on the issue of consent. As in all cases, within the marital relationship the circumstances surrounding the allegations must be  carefully scrutinized to determine whether the words or actions of the spouse could honestly have been misinterpreted as positive communications of consent. The existence of the marital relationship, however, does not entitle a spouse to assume consent unless otherwise advised. I find that W.A.T. has failed to raise a reasonable doubt in my mind that he honestly but mistakenly believed in the complainant’s consent. I find that his testimony does not raise a reasonable doubt on the issue of whether he knew she was not consenting.



[103]      I must go on to consider the rest of the evidence to determine if it proves W.A.T.’s lack of honest belief that she communicated her consent to him beyond a reasonable doubt.




[104]      The complainant’s testimony was that on some occasions W.A.T. had sexual intercourse with her from behind while her body was turned away from his and after she had verbally expressed to him that she did not want to have sex. She was not cross-examined on the physiological improbability of sex occurring without her participation. She stated that W.A.T. would use his hand to guide his penis into her vagina. She did not participate in the sexual activity but simply lay still. She recalled crying on one occasion and that he would have heard her cry. She recalled an occasion where the next morning he apologized for having raped her.



[105]      While I have carefully considered the fact that there were also on her testimony instances of consensual sexual relations between them during the time frame of the indictment, the distinction between those incidents and the non-consensual events were very clear in the complainant’s testimony. There was no indication in her evidence that she was confusing in her own mind the instances when she expressed her consent to him and those when she did not.



[106]      I have also considered the testimony in relation to the admissions of “rape” made by the accused in his journal and to Mr. Dudley and the counselors as corroborative of the complainant’s testimony that W.A.T. engaged in non-consensual sexual relations with the complainant knowing that she was not consenting.



[107]      For the reasons expressed earlier in relation to the actus reus, I am not of the view that the complainant’s evidence as to whether she communicated consent is undermined by the email she sent to W.A.T. in March 2008.  I am of the view that despite his violation of her sexual integrity, she was still at that point feeling guilty about failure in her spousal role and was hoping the marriage could somehow succeed and their family kept intact. Nor am I of the view that her comments to W.A.T. and to the police about wanting custody materially affect her credibility for the reasons earlier given.



[108]      I find that neither the evidence of the accused nor the other evidence before me has raised a reasonable doubt in my mind as to honest but mistaken belief in consent on the part of W.A.T.



[109]      I find that the incidents of non-consensual sexual intercourse occurred between September 2006 through March, 2008. The complainant was unable to say how many times the acts occurred but recalled as many as five such occasions in some months and as few as 0 to 1 occasions in others during the time frame of the indictment. I am satisfied that they occurred on at least 10 occasions based on this evidence and also on her testimony that the incidents occurred maybe 10 times in one year. I also find that there were occasions, uncontroverted by W.A.T.’s testimony, that he ejaculated on the underwear the complainant was wearing while she was asleep. However, the evidence was very sparse on this issue and left me with questions as to how exactly this occurred. The law requires the complainant to establish that the actions of the accused were intentional in the sense of voluntary and not accidental and that he knew that she was not consenting. I am of the view that these elements have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt not because I do not believe the complainant but because of the sparsity of the evidence on these incidents. Accordingly my findings as to guilt are limited to those incidents I have referred to where sexual intercourse occurred without the complainant’s consent on at least 10 occasions during the period of the indictment.
