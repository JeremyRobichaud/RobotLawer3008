ANALYSIS

[31]                  There are no witnesses to the assaults alleged in the information.  Assessment of credibility is clearly a crucial task.  In undertaking that assessment, I have in mind the direction of Justice Peter Cory in  R. v. W. (D.), (1991) 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 S.C.C.:

•   “First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.

•     Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.

•      Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.”

 

 

Evidence of Mr. H.

[32]                  The defendant was consistent in denying that he ever assaulted Ms. N.. I do not believe his evidence, nor am I left in reasonable doubt by it, for the reasons I set out below.

[33]                  Internal inconsistency.  I refer below to some instances of inconsistency in the defendant’s evidence.

[34]                  One glaring instance relates to his evidence about the assault with an umbrella alleged to have occurred in August 2009. The inconsistencies are obvious, and were not explained in his evidence.

[35]                  A further example of inconsistency in the defendant’s evidence concerns his testimony about his receipt of psychological treatment. In cross-examination, the defendant was asked whether he historically had received treatment for depression and poor impulse control; he denied the suggestion indignantly, explaining that he had seen a psychologist briefly because of an adverse reaction to medication prescribed in the course of dental surgery. Later, his evidence was that he had received psychological counselling “for years”.

[36]                  A further example concerns the defendant’s response to the questions from his lawyer as to whether he had ever assaulted Ms. N.. When the question was first asked, the defendant paused noticeably, asked for the question to be repeated, and then stated that Ms. N. had “blown it out of proportion”.  This suggested an admission that there were assaults, but that they were exaggerated.  However, later, the defendant emphatically and repeatedly denied any assaults.

[37]                  Inconsistency with other evidence.  The defendant denied or minimised facts that might reflect unfavourably upon him, when there was clear and believable evidence to the contrary. For example, he maintained that he had “no difficulty” controlling his anger at any time, despite the following:

•        The defendant testified that he made very serious threats of violence to Ms. N. and her father. When pushed on cross-examination, he conceded that when he made these threats that he was “angry”, but not “out of control”, not “furious”.

•        Mrs. H. testified that the defendant when angry had thrown and broken objects, punched walls, and smashed windows, and that he had damaged Ms. N.’s cell phone and her ring.  The defendant did not deny these allegations.

[38]                  Animus against Ms. N. It was clear from the defendant’s own evidence that he was resentful of Ms. N.  He complained that she nagged him to spend more time with her. He complained that she pressured him to marry her.  He was angry that she was not more circumspect about his psychological difficulties and treatment.

[39]                  I turn now to a consideration of all the other evidence which I heard, beginning with the evidence of Ms. N.

 

 

Other evidence

[40]                  Defence counsel submits that Ms. N. is “utterly lacking in credibility” for several reasons:

1.                  Recent fabrication. As referred to above, it is alleged that Ms. N. fabricated stories of abuse as revenge against the defendant for terminating their relationship.

2.                  Embellishment of evidence.  Counsel alleges that Ms. N.’s evidence that there were other incidents of abuse that she did not relate to officers taking her KGB statement is a further indication that she is fabricating.

3.                  Internal inconsistency. Counsel also submits that Ms. N. has given “ten different stories” about the same event. Counsel points to factors that he argues are inconsistent with her evidence that she was assaulted by the defendant over a period of 16 months:

•                    Loving notes sent by Ms. N. to the defendant, produced by the defendant in evidence, which do not refer to abuse.

•                    Ms. N.’s failure to complain of abuse earlier to police, teachers, or her father.

 

I deal with these submissions below.

 

[41]                  Recent fabrication.  The accusation of recent fabrication by Ms. N. in reprisal for the defendant’s termination of their relationship is not born out for two reasons.

1.                  It was the principal of Ms. N.’s school, and not Ms. N., who contacted police with concerns about the defendant’s behaviour. 

2.                  Both Mr. M. and Ms. K. gave evidence that Ms. N. had confided in them about assaults by the defendant, and her worries about these assaults, in the months prior to the separation on November 12, 2010.  Evidence of these complaints is not corroborative of assault, but can properly be considered to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication[3]. Both witnesses also gave evidence as to physical indicators of alleged assaults observed by them, some of which relate to the events which form the basis for the charges, and some as to other alleged assaults.

 

[42]                  I found both Mr. M. and Ms. K. to be careful and balanced witnesses. Mr. M. testified that he had never seen the defendant be physically aggressive with Ms. N.; he described the defendant’s usual manner of speaking to Ms. N. as “calm and gentle”.  Ms. K., in her evidence about a dispute between the parties which she had observed from some distance, testified as to a bite mark she observed on Ms. N.’s shoulder when she returned from the confrontation, but was careful to say that she did not witness an actual assault.

[43]                  I add that the fact that I reject the allegation of recent fabrication on Ms. N.’s part does not, of course, equate with a finding that Ms. N. is being truthful.

[44]                  Embellishment of evidence.  Ms. N. readily acknowledged that her evidence at trial detailed many more assaults than those she discussed in her KGB statement.  As the recording of Ms. N.’s KGB statement was not introduced into evidence, I do not know what questions Ms. N. was responding to in that statement.  When asked by defence counsel why she did not discuss all the alleged assaults in her interview with police, Ms. N. testified that she told officers about “the most important ones”, the ones which she considered to be the most serious.  She did not think that she was being asked to relate each and every incident of assault; “if I did that, I would have been there all day”, she commented.

[45]                  This explanation makes sense to me.  I do not believe that Ms. N.’s failure to detail every assault that she alleges she experienced to police detracts from her credibility. It should also be kept in mind that the statement was taken on the same day that she experienced the death threats made by the defendant, a day on which, according to her evidence, she was fearful and confused.

[46]                  Internal inconsistency.  The allegation that Ms. N. is lacking in credibility because she did not come forward earlier to complain to police or teachers is an allegation of recent fabrication in another guise[4].  I have already rejected that allegation for the reasons set out above.   Ms. N. testified that she did not come forward with allegations of assault to the police or to others in authority in her world because she felt ashamed, and did not want to accept that she was in “that kind” of relationship; because she loved the defendant; because she thought that the defendant would change, and that she could help him; because she did not want to be the person who turned him in.  These are all explanations which I accept; a young person in love may be a victim of abuse, but may still be reluctant to take actions that would hurt her partner or terminate the relationship.

[47]                  In the same vein, the fact that Ms. N. was writing love notes to the defendant which do not complain of domestic violence is not inconsistent with her participation in a relationship which allegedly was riddled with violence.  Some of the notes show a pathetic eagerness on Ms. N.’s part to apologise repeatedly to the defendant for having argued with him. I note also that Ms. N. testified that there were notes she wrote to the defendant that referred to his violence, notes which she says he chose not to introduce into evidence.

[48]                  I do not agree with defence counsel’s submission that Ms. N. told “ten different stories” of the alleged assaults. She was internally consistent in her description of various alleged assaults, and her evidence was generally consistent with the evidence of other witnesses (other than that of the defendant).  With the exception of her evidence about the assault alleged to have occurred April 1-30, 2010, Ms. N.’s evidence was also detailed, specifying the particulars of place and the actions of the defendant and herself at the time of each alleged assault. I also note that Ms. N. was candid in agreeing to certain facts that might unfavourably reflect upon her allegations of assault, such as the assertion that she sometimes physically restrained the defendant when he tried to leave her company. She did not demonstrate animus to the defendant. Rather, she testified that the defendant was “a great person”, for whom she still had loving feelings, but a person who “needed help”.

[49]                  In my view, Ms. N. was a credible witness, who gave her evidence honestly. There are factors that detract from her reliability. I do not think that Ms. N. gave false evidence, but on occasion she appeared to exaggerate.  For example, during cross-examination, she testified that the defendant’s assaults were a “daily” occurrence; other evidence established that although she and the defendant saw each other frequently, it was not on a daily basis. I have considered Ms. N.’s tendency to exaggerate in my assessment of the evidence.

[50]                  I also found that Ms. N. sometimes had difficulty being precise about the time of certain events.  I discuss this issue further below.

[51]                  I turn now to a consideration of the evidence which I accept as it applies to each charge.

[52]                  Assault charge: April 1-30, 2010. Ms. N. had difficulty recalling when some alleged incidents occurred; she testified that she had wanted to forget the events, as they were a painful memory. Although time is not usually an essential element with respect to charges of assault[5], the wide variation in Ms. N.’s evidence as to the time of the alleged assault in the period April 1-30, 2010, coupled with the lack of detail in her description of the event leads me to question whether Ms. N. testified about one actual event, or whether she was piecing together more than one occurrence in an effort to create a coherent account. There is no corroborating evidence available. I am left with reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has proven this charge, and acquit the defendant accordingly.

[53]                  Assault causing bodily harm charge:  August 1-31, 2009. Ms. N. was clear, detailed, and consistent in her evidence about the incident.  The fact that she suffered a cut to her head that day is corroborated by both the defendant and Mrs. H. 

[54]                  Mrs. H.’s evidence about this event differs from Ms. N.’s in one respect; she testified that Ms. N. came to her home (complaining of the head injury and asking whether she thought stitches were required) alone, rather than in the company of the defendant. Given the passage of time since the alleged assault, I do not find this minor variation in the evidence to be significant.

[55]                  Based on all the evidence which I accept, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant assaulted Ms. N. with an umbrella as alleged. However, the evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the injury caused by this assault was more than minor and transitory. For this reason, I do not make a finding of guilt on the charge of assault causing bodily harm, but do find the defendant guilty of simple assault.

[56]                  Assault charge:  on or about December 25, 2009.  Ms. N.’s evidence about this event was also detailed and internally consistent. 

[57]                  Although evidence from Mrs. H. as well as Ms. N. establishes that no assault took place on December 25 or 26, 2009, this does not ultimately assist the defendant, as both the information and the evidence refer to an assault alleged to have occurred during a broader period of time.  The information alleges an assault “on or about” December 25, 2009. I heard no argument as to the meaning that should be ascribed to “on or about”.  By a plain reading, it is meant to refer to a time period which encompasses some time before or after the date in question. Ms. N.’s evidence was that the assault occurred during “Christmastime”, which I take as a reference to the Christmas holiday season. In my view, that period can come within the period referred to in the information. I also add that in my view, time is not an essential element with respect to this charge, and the Crown was not required to prove that the defence occurred on a particular date.[6]

[58]                  Based on all the evidence which I accept, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant assaulted Ms. N. during the Christmas season in 2009.

[59]                  Assault charge: October 14-31, 2010.  Here again, Ms. N.’s evidence was detailed and internally consistent.  Her evidence on when she showed Mr. M. her bloodstained duvet differs from Mr. M.’s. I prefer Mr. M.’s recollection on this point.  His recall is not affected by the emotion and confusion experienced by Ms. N. during the time in question. 

[60]                  The fact that Mr. N. did not happen to notice the blood stain is not significant to me in assessing whether an assault occurred. There is no evidence that Mr. N. was in his daughter’s bedroom at the relevant time period. Nr, N. is a busy single parent. He does not impress me as particularly observant about the details of his daughter’s life.  His evidence was that he saw certain signs, such as a broken mirror, which might have suggested that some violence occurred in his home, but he did not pursue any questions raised by these signs. Mr. N. did not remember the defendant’s surname, although the young man had been his daughter’s boyfriend and a frequent guest in his home for more than a year.

[61]                  Ms. N.’s evidence about this event is corroborated by Mr. M.’s observation of the bloodstain on her duvet when she called him in distress. On the defendant’s own evidence, he was by this time growing increasingly frustrated with the demands which Ms. N. put upon him.

[62]                  Based on all the evidence which I do accept, I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant assaulted Ms. N. as alleged during this time. 

 

Other alleged assaults

[63]                  I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant assaulted Ms. N. on occasions other than those alleged in the information, and specifically at the times alleged in August 2010 and October 2010. My reasons are set out below.

[64]                  With respect to the incident in August 2010, it is significant to me that Ms. N.’s evidence about the large bruise on her upper right arm is corroborated by S.M. and Mr. N, two witnesses who do not appear to have animus against the defendant. I have already commented on the credibility of S.M.  Despite the fact that the defendant was alleged to have assaulted his daughter, Mr. N. had nothing negative to say about him.  He testified that he had never seen the defendant assault or be rough with Ms. N., and that the only criticism he had of the defendant related to his appearance.

[65]                  I believe that Mrs. H. gave her evidence honestly; on cross-examination, she readily admitted certain occurrences that were not helpful to him, such as his past difficulties with impulse control.  However, I am concerned about the reliability of her evidence with respect to the lack of any bruising on Ms. N.’s arm in August 2010.  I am not sure she would have noticed a bruise; as Mrs. H. admitted, she was entertaining many people at the cottage that week. Aside from that, I have some concern that her recollection of that week may have been tainted by discussions with her son.  Although Mrs. H. was excluded from the courtroom prior to giving her evidence, during her testimony it became clear that she was aware of the particulars of Ms. N.’s evidence about certain incidents. When questioned about this by the Crown, Mrs. H. explained that she had attended with her son at his lawyer’s to review disclosure and the evidence. 

[66]                  With respect to whether Ms. N. sustained a large bruise at the time in question, I prefer the evidence of S.M. and Mr. N to that of Mrs. H.

[67]                  With respect to the assault alleged in October 2010, the evidence of Ms. N. is corroborated by Ms. K., whom I have already found to be a credible witness. It is clear that the defendant was angry with Ms. N. on the day in question.

[68]                  My findings with respect to these other assaults were helpful to me in understanding the dynamics of the relationship of the defendant and Ms. N.
