[23]        Taking all of the factors as previously articulated into consideration, I am of the view that an appropriate disposition would be life imprisonment with no chance of parole for 22 years on each count to be served concurrent to each other.  This properly acknowledges the loss of two lives, without crushing future prospects for Sharpe.  It also means that Sharpe will serve a significant period of time in custody before parole authorities will have to decide if he has made the necessary progress to merit some form of release into the community.  It is important to remember that the sentence is one of life imprisonment.  There is no guarantee that Sharpe will ever be released.

[24]        Finally, I make the following ancillary orders pursuant to the Criminal Code:

(a)      mandatory lifetime firearms prohibition (s. 109);

(b)     mandatory DNA order (s. 487.051);

(c)      no contact with members of Jeffrey’s family or Dabreo’s family (s. 743.21(1)).
