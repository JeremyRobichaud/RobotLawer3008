III.            Conclusion
[32]            The Accused has failed to establish that the two statements to the police were made either when he was arrested or when he was first accused of committing a crime. Further, he has failed to establish that the statements were spontaneous.

[33]           The application by the Accused to introduce into evidence the two statements he made to the police on April 3, 2017 is denied.

[34]           In view of my finding that the Accused has failed to establish the requirements set out in Edgar for the admissibility of the statements, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether Edgar reflects, or should reflect, the state of the law in Alberta.
