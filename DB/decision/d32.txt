10            I am unable to say that the learned trial judge erred.  In my opinion the sentence, bearing in mind that it can be reviewed by the judge, should be 2 years and 9 months secure custody on the first count and 2 years secure custody on the second count, the sentences to be concurrent. 

 

11            One can only hope that this extensive period of secure custody may lead, as well, to the rehabilitation of this young man.  He will have an opportunity to finish his high school and to learn to come to grips with his drug and alcohol addiction and, perhaps, come to lead a reasonably law abiding life.

 

12            I would grant leave and allow the appeal by reducing the sentences accordingly.
