The accused, who did not give evidence or call wit­nesses at his trial, made a voluntary statement to the police in which he confirmed that intercourse had taken place but said that it had occurred with the complai­nant's consent and without the use of force or threats on his part. This statement was put in evidence at the trial. The accused now appeals on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that drunkenness was not a defence to a charge of rape.
