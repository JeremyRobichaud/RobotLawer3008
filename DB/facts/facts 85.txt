[1]               The respondent was convicted in 2013 of two counts of infanticide of her newborns delivered in 2008 and 2009. The Crown appeals and seeks a new trial on two counts of second degree murder of the newborns. For the reasons set out below, we dismiss the appeal.

Background Facts
[2]               On October 19, 2010, a newborn infant was found crying in a dumpster. The police noticed the respondent sitting nearby, wrapped in a blanket with blood on it, and watching the activity around the dumpster. EMS personnel noticed the respondent had stretch marks on her abdomen, blood near her waist and ankles, and appeared anxious. She claimed the blood was from heavy periods experienced since a prior miscarriage. After arrest on October 19, 2010, the respondent admitted she had given birth that day and gave details to the police.

[3]               Police investigation continued and the respondent was re-arrested and re-interviewed on November 16, 2011. In her statement, she admitted to delivering two other babies and leaving each of them in a dumpster.

[4]               At trial, both the October 19, 2010 and November 16, 2011 statements to the police were admitted. Evidence related to the 2010 birth was admitted as similar act evidence.

[5]               In her November 2011 statement, the respondent described the first two pregnancies and births. The first baby was born in 2008. The respondent claimed that she did not know that she was even pregnant until late and did not tell her boyfriend in order to avoid upsetting him. The respondent did not recall the date of the birth but remembered giving birth in bed when her boyfriend was out of town and her roommate was asleep. She did not recall if the baby was a boy or girl. She wrapped the baby in a towel, put it in a garbage bag and put the garbage bag in a dumpster outside the house. The respondent heard the baby make a sound. She said that she was scared during the delivery, and scared and remorseful after disposing of the baby, but thought it was over. The next day, a co-worker saw blood running down the respondent’s thigh but the respondent admitted she lied and said it was her period.

[6]               The second baby was born in July 2009. Again, the respondent did not tell anyone she was pregnant as she did not want her parents to be angry with her or to lose her boyfriend. Co-workers thought the respondent was pregnant but she denied it and told them that she had cysts in her uterus. The respondent gave birth to the second baby in the bathroom of her apartment when her boyfriend and his brother were downstairs.

[7]               The respondent claimed she did not know whether it was a boy or girl. The respondent wrapped the baby in a towel, then placed it in two garbage bags and then put the bags in a dumpster. The respondent heard the baby cry but could not recall when. She said she felt she was not in control and not normal. The respondent agreed she wrapped the baby in a towel to keep it warm and to protect the baby. At work, when co-workers noticed her belly was gone, she lied and said she had a miscarriage.

[8]               In her first statement to the police after the third baby was born in October 2010, the respondent said she did not know she was pregnant. She panicked and put the baby in the dumpster. She said she was scared, did not know what to do and her immediate reaction was to try to make the baby go away. The respondent claimed she had a miscarriage before and repeatedly said she could not think properly or rationally. The respondent stated she did not know what to do and did not know she was capable of what she had done. When asked if there had been a previous time where she had done something and not known why, she replied, “nothing to this degree”.

[9]               In her November 2011 statement to the police, the respondent said she never wanted to hurt the baby and if she had known she was pregnant, she would have handled it differently. She said she was terrified, felt she could not control anything and did not know what she was thinking. The respondent said she wished things were different. She denied having been in that situation before. The respondent said she had a previous miscarriage and no other pregnancies. She was angry when she was challenged about prior pregnancies.

[10]           After describing co-workers’ observations of the changes in her appearance, the respondent was asked what happened with the second pregnancy. The respondent answered, “same as the third”. She then described some details about the first and second baby.

[11]           The respondent did not testify on her own behalf at trial.

Expert Evidence at Trial
[12]           At trial, two experts gave opinion evidence in forensic psychiatry and assessment of retrospective mental states. Dr. Hashman, the court-appointed psychiatrist, completed a 60-day assessment pursuant to the provisions of section 672.11(c) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 [Criminal Code]. The respondent was pregnant with her fourth child at the time she was examined by Dr. Hashman.

[13]           He was of the opinion that the balance of the respondent’s mind was not disturbed at the time of the offences, relying on her detailed recollection of giving birth, disposing of the babies, then immediately returning to normal routine. In his view, this behaviour was inconsistent with someone suffering a major mental disturbance. There was no evidence of an acute mental disturbance and he did not see a level of distress disproportionate to the circumstances. In his opinion, depersonalization, detachment from self, is common when a person is stressed; the respondent’s depersonalization was not disproportionate to the stress.

[14]           Dr. Smith, the defence expert, examined the respondent for seven hours in 2013 and examined hospital records and police statements. She agreed with most of Dr. Hashman’s reports. She described the respondent as having low self-esteem and as someone who avoids facing difficult decisions and choices. In Dr. Smith’s view, the respondent’s descriptions of not being in control, not being normal, being unable to think clearly and observing from outside her body were consistent with depersonalization. She was of the opinion that the respondent’s mind was disturbed. Due to the respondent’s coping mechanism of denial, all three deliveries were unexpected, resulting in high levels of panic and anxiety which triggered depersonalization.
