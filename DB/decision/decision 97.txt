IX.      Conclusion
[56]           As I have said throughout, by virtue of s. 13 of the ITOA this is the result that would follow, not only for any Canadian who offends outside Canada and is transferred to Canada, but also to those who are similarly sentenced within Canada.

[57]           The interpretation by the CSC that Mr. Khadr should be placed in a penitentiary is the correct statutory interpretation. Accordingly, the application for habeas corpus is dismissed.

[58]           The parties may speak to costs within 90 days, or any extension granted thereof prior to the 90 days.
