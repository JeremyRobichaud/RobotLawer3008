D.      ANALYSIS
[22]           The main issue on this sentencing hearing is whether the mandatory s. 745(a) sentence of life imprisonment with 25 years parole ineligibility should be made consecutive or concurrent to the same sentence that both accused are already serving for a separate murder. A subsidiary issue is whether the new statutory discretion in s. 745.51, to impose consecutive parole ineligibility periods, permits part of the 25 year period of ineligibility to be concurrent and part to be consecutive. A final related issue is whether this statutory scheme violates the Charter of Rights.

[23]           A statutory power to impose consecutive sentences has always existed in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code. In the R.S.C. 1970, c.C-34 version of the Code, it was set out in s. 645 in terms that had remained largely unchanged since the original 1892 Code. In the R.S.C. 1985, c.C-46 version of the Code, it was found in s.717. Finally, in the current Criminal Code, after the substantial 1996 revisions to Part XXIII, it is now found in s.718.3. The old statutory language, prior to the 1996 revisions, was as follows:

(4) Where an accused

(a) is convicted while under sentence for an offence, and a term of imprisonment, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, is imposed,

…

(c) is convicted of more offences than one before the same court at the same sittings, and

…

(ii) terms of imprisonment for the respective offences are imposed, or

(iii) a term of imprisonment is imposed in respect of one offence and a fine is imposed in respect of another offence with a direction that, in default of payment, the accused shall be imprisoned for a term certain,

the court that convicts the accused may direct that the terms of imprisonment shall be served one after the other.

The modern statutory language, at the time of the present offence, was as follows:

(4) The court… that sentences an accused may direct that the terms of imprisonment that are imposed by the court… shall be served consecutively, when

(a) the accused is sentenced while under sentence for an offence, and a term of imprisonment, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, is imposed;

(b) the accused is found guilty or convicted of an offence punishable with both a fine and imprisonment and both are imposed;

(c) the accused is found guilty or convicted of more than one offence, and

…

(ii) terms of imprisonment for the respective offences are imposed, or

(iii) a term of imprisonment is imposed in respect of one offence and a fine is imposed in respect of another offence;…

There was a further revision to the language of s. 718.3(4) in 2015. It is not relevant to the present 2012 offence and so I have not set out the current statutory language.

[24]           It can be seen that the old statutory power and the modern statutory power both provide the trial judge with a discretion to impose consecutive sentences in two circumstances: first, where the accused is already “under sentence for an offence”; and second, where the accused is “convicted of more than one offence”. The former circumstance applies where the accused has already been sentenced in some earlier proceedings. The latter circumstance applies where the accused is convicted of separate offences and is being sentenced in one proceeding or in ongoing proceedings before the same judge. The current statutory language in s. 718.3(4) continues to provide for consecutive sentences in these two circumstances. See R. v. Paul (1982) 1982 CanLII 179 (SCC), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 97 (S.C.C.) where the long common law and statutory history of this discretionary power to impose consecutive sentences is set out in considerable detail by Lamer J. , as he then was, speaking on behalf of the Court.

[25]           Millard and Smich clearly fall within the former circumstance set out in s. 718.3(4)(a), as they are being sentenced for the 2012 Babcock murder in Toronto “while under sentence” for the 2013 Bosma murder in Hamilton. Although the plain and literal statutory language of the above longstanding Criminal Code power to impose consecutive sentences would appear to apply to two separate murders, the courts in Canada and England held that this would be an “absurdity”. The premise of this line of authority is that a life sentence does not expire until the accused’s death. As a result, any sentence consecutive to a life sentence, imposed for some further offence, would be an “impossibility” as it would never commence. The root case is R. v. Foy (1962) 46 Cr. App. R. 290 at p. 292 (C.C.A.) where the Lord Chief Justice held that a 14 year sentence, made consecutive to an earlier life sentence, was “wholly invalid”. He stated:

Life imprisonment means imprisonment for life. No doubt, many people come out from life imprisonment while they are still alive, but if such a person does come out, it is only on licence, and the sentence of life imprisonment remains on him until he dies. Accordingly, if the court passes a sentence of any period of years consecutive to life, the sentence is no sentence at all in that it cannot operate until the prisoner dies.

[26]           The Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with this reasoning in R. v. Sinclair (1972) 1972 CanLII 1297 (ON CA), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 523 (Ont. C.A.). After quoting the above passage from Foy, Jessup J.A. (MacKay and Evans JJ.A. concurring) stated:

If we substitute the words “on parole” for “on licence”, what was said by the learned Chief Justice has equal force in this country. That is so notwithstanding the power that a literal reading of s. 645 of the Criminal Code [now s. 718.3] ostensibly gives to a Court to impose a consecutive sentence even in the circumstances of this case. The maxim lex non intendit aliquid impossible applies with equal force to statutory law and has the effect that s. 645 must be construed as excluding from its grant of jurisdiction the power to make a sentence of a term of years consecutive to a sentence of life imprisonment. Parliament cannot have contemplated both a physical impossibility and a logical absurdity which tends to bring the law into disrepute.

Also see: R. v. Cadeddu (1980) 1980 CanLII 2968 (ON CA), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 264 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Cooney (1981) 1981 CanLII 3192 (QC CA), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Robillard (1985) 1985 CanLII 3530 (QC CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 505 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Camphaug (1986) 1986 CanLII 1164 (BC CA), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 125 (B.C.C.A.).

[27]           The early cases in this line of authority, that is, Foy and Sinclair, pre-dated the abolition of capital punishment in 1976, the enactment of first degree and second degree murder, and the imposition of mandatory ten year and 25 year minimum periods of parole ineligibility (which were enacted in substitution for the death penalty). Accordingly, there was no consideration given in Foy or Sinclair as to whether a further sentence could logically run consecutive to a period of parole ineligibility. Both Cadeddu and Camphaug, however, were post-1976 cases where the two accused were already serving life sentences for murder with minimum periods of parole ineligibility, at the time of their sentencing for further offences. Both courts in those two cases referred briefly to this new issue, concerning the potential for sentences consecutive to a period of parole ineligibility, but were reluctant to depart from the rather emphatic earlier authority in Foy and Sinclair. In R. v. Cadeddu, supra at p. 266, Morden J.A., as he then was (Howland C.J.O. and Jessup J.A. concurring), stated that any further sentence had to be concurrent to a life sentence but that “it is reasonable to think that the subsequent conviction and sentence… will be factors which the Parole Board would take into account in determining the question of actual parole”.

[28]           The enactment of s. 745.51 in 2011 has now partially reversed the above line of authority by providing for a discretion to order that periods of parole ineligibility that are part of a life sentence can run consecutively in the case of multiple murder convictions (but presumably not in the case of further offences other than murder). This new power does not appear to enact a statutory test for when consecutive sentences are appropriate. It simply requires the judge to consider three specific factors, namely: “the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and the recommendation” of the jury. These are factors that would apply in any event, pursuant to normal sentencing principles. The new s. 745.51 power is situated within Part XXIII of the Criminal Code and the parties agree that the normal sentencing principles set out in this Part apply. I agree with the parties on this point. In R. v. Shropshire (1995) 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at paras. 23-4 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J. gave the unanimous judgement of the full Court. He stated the following concerning the somewhat related s. 744 discretionary power to increase the ten year minimum period of parole ineligibility for second degree murder (now s. 745.4):

The only difference in terms of punishment between first and second degree murder is the duration of parole ineligibility. This clearly indicates that parole ineligibility is part of the “punishment” and thereby forms an important element of sentencing policy. As such, it must be concerned with deterrence, whether general or specific. The jurisprudence of this court is clear that deterrence is a well-established objective of sentencing policy. In R. v. Lyons (1987), 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p. 22 (S.C.C.), La Forest J. held:

In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender. No one would suggest that any of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.

Section 744 must be concerned with all the factors cited in Lyons. In R. v. Luxton (1990), 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), the importance of structuring sentences to take into account the individual accused and the particular crime was emphasized. This is also a factor that any order made pursuant to s. 744 ought to take into consideration.

The exercise of a trial judge’s discretion under s. 744 should not be more strictly circumscribed than the sentencing itself. [Emphasis added].

More recently, in R. v. Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64 at paras. 53-6, 62, and 71, the Court reiterated its longstanding view that “dangerous offender proceedings are sentencing proceedings”, even though the dangerous offender provisions in s. 753 are found in their own Part XXIV and are not found in Part XXIII. [Emphasis added]. Starting with this premise, Coté J. went on to state the following, speaking for eight members of the Court:

Accordingly, a sentencing judge in a dangerous offender proceeding must apply the sentencing principles and mandatory guidelines outlined in ss. 718 to 718.2… These sentencing principles apply to every sentencing decision… nothing in the wording of s. 753(4.1) removes the obligation incumbent on a sentencing judge to consider all sentencing principles in order to choose a sentence that is fit for a specific offender… Every sentence must be imposed after an individualized assessment of all of the relevant factors and circumstances. [Emphasis added].

[29]           Applying the above principles from Shropshire and Boutilier, I am satisfied that the new s. 745.51 discretion is part of the sentencing proceedings and that the normal principles of sentencing found in Part XXIII and in the common law apply to the exercise of this discretion. The longstanding general s. 718.3 power to impose consecutive sentences, which s. 745.51 has now partially restored in the case of multiple murders, does not include a statutory test as to when consecutive sentences are appropriate. It simply enacts a discretion. The new s. 745.51 power is no different, enacting a statutory discretion without imposing a particular statutory test. The legal test in English and Canadian sentencing law, as to when consecutive sentences are appropriate, emerged through common law decisions of the courts. The root case in Ontario is R. v. Chisholm 1965 CanLII 211 (ON CA), [1965] 4 C.C.C. 289 at 291 (Ont. C.A.) where Roach J.A. stated:

We do not think that, in the circumstances that exist here, there should be concurrent sentences. As I have already stated there was no relationship between any of these four robberies. If sentences were to be concurrent in such cases, that would almost be an inducement to a criminal to not refrain from crimes of the same sort or even of different sorts, committed at times closely related to one another. He would reason that, if he were caught on the first one, any sentence that he would get on the others would likely be concurrent and his liberty not further restrained because of his committing these other offences.

In our view the sentences should be consecutive. The Court should keep in mind the total term imposed in consecutive sentences. [Emphasis added].

[30]           A two step approach to the issue of concurrent versus consecutive sentences emerged out of cases like Chisholm, namely, assessing first whether there was a factual “relationship” between the two or more offences and then assessing whether consecutive sentences resulted in a “total term” that was excessive. The second issue, known as the “totality principle”, is now statutorily codified in s. 718.2(c) which provides that, “where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh”. The first issue is fact specific and the courts have not imposed any rigid meaning as to the “relationship”, “nexus”, or “connection” between two or more offences that would justify concurrent sentences. In R. v. W.Q. (2006) 2006 CanLII 21035 (ON CA), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 398 at paras. 11-15 (Ont. C.A.), the Court adopted the views expressed in Ruby et al, Sentencing, 9th Ed. (Toronto: Lexis Nexis, 2017) at pp. 588-595 on this point:

The authors [of Ruby et al] conclude, after reviewing several examples at paragraph 14.13:

Ultimately, the tests are very flexible, and it becomes a fact-specific inquiry whether the connection between two offences is sufficiently or insufficiently close to merit either consecutive or concurrent sentences.

Also see: D.A. Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (London: Heinemann, 1970) at pp. 47-52.

[31]           On its facts, W.Q. involved an ongoing series of sexual assaults on the accused’s step-daughter. The assaults ended early in July 2000 when the step-daughter moved out of the family home. During the period of the assaults, the accused “manipulated and controlled” the victim through “intimidation”. Some two months after she moved out, in September 2000, the accused began phoning the victim and threatening her at her new residence. The trial judge imposed consecutive sentences for the sexual assaults and for the subsequent criminal harassment offence. The Court of Appeal agreed. MacFarland J.A. (Simmons and Rouleau JJ.A. concurring) reasoned as follows:

In my view, however, it was open to the trial judge on the facts of this case to order a consecutive sentence. In her reasons for sentence, the trial judge referred to the criminal harassment being “an ill-fated attempt on the part of the accused to try to continue his sphere of influence over the complainant in the nastiest manner”. This conduct occurred after the complainant had moved away from the appellant’s home; in some respects, it was of a different nature than the intimidating and manipulating conduct to which the appellant subjected her while they lived in the same house. Particularly in light of those factors, it was open to the trial judge to find that a consecutive sentence was, in all of the circumstances, appropriate. In effect, there was not the close factual nexus that would make a consecutive sentence inappropriate. Nor, as I will explain did it make the total sentence imposed unfit. [Emphasis added].

[32]           More recently, in R. v. Maroti (2010) 2010 MBCA 54 (CanLII), 256 C.C.C. (3d) 332 at paras. 12-25 (Man. C.A.), the Court thoroughly reviewed the law relating to this issue. Like the Ontario Court of Appeal in W.Q., the Manitoba Court of Appeal adopted the views expressed in Ruby et al, Sentencing, supra, to the effect that the test is “very flexible” and “fact specific” as to whether two offences are sufficiently connected to both justify concurrent sentences and to make consecutive sentences inappropriate. Steel J.A. gave the judgement of the Court and described the flexible test that has emerged in the following terms:

First, the courts use a multitude of phrases to express the same concept. See, for example, Ruby et al., at para. 14.10 – “‘a break in the transaction’; ‘really separate invasions of the community’s right to peace and order, notwithstanding that they are historically interdependent’; ‘one multi-faceted course of criminal conduct’; ‘one transaction’; ‘part of the same transaction or endeavour’; ‘closely linked together’; ‘one continuous criminal act’; ‘one single enterprise’; ‘single criminal adventure’; and ‘reasonably close nexus’”. Although different courts have at different times used each of these phrases, I believe that they were all attempting to answer the same question – Is the connection between two offences sufficiently close to order the sentences imposed to be served concurrently as opposed to consecutively? [Emphasis added].

Also see R. v. Taylor (2010) 2010 MBCA 103 (CanLII), 263 C.C.C. (3d) 307 at paras. 11 and 15-16 (Man. C.A.) to the effect that consecutive sentences should be imposed where offences are “separate and distinct”.

[33]           Applying the above principles to the case at bar, I have no difficulty in concluding that the two murders of Tim Bosma and Laura Babcock are sufficiently “separate and distinct” to justify consecutive sentences and that they do not have the “close factual nexus” that would make concurrent sentences appropriate. They are not proximate in time as the Babcock murder occurred on July 3/4, 2012 and the Bosma murder occurred some ten months later on May 6, 2013. They occurred in different kinds of locations and they arose in different cities, one in a suburban home in Toronto and the other in a truck near Hamilton. They involved two different victims who had no connection to each other. They involved different means, methods and opportunities, as one victim was a former lover who was lured to the scene of the crime at a time of need and infatuation, and the other involved a private vendor of a truck who was lured to the scene of the crime by a potential offer to purchase his Dodge 3500 truck. Finally, they involved distinct motives as the former lover had become a nuisance to Millard and his jealous girlfriend, whereas the vendor of the truck was apparently an impediment to Millard’s and Smich’s plans to steal the truck.

[34]           The only similarity or connection between the two murders is that they both involved the use of The Eliminator, as the common means to dispose of the bodies after the two murders had been carried out. In this regard, the two murders are also connected by the broader criminal conspiracy between Millard and Smich, in which The Eliminator figured somewhat prominently as a means of destroying evidence. There is no doubt from the text messages between Millard and Smich that they began discussing “a proper plan” to “grab that truck… a Dodge 3500… a 3500 mission” in March, April and May of 2012, around the same time that the plan to kill Ms. Babcock crystalized. The Eliminator was delivered to Millard’s airport hangar on July 5, 2012, the day after Ms. Babcock’s murder, and it was then prepared and used to incinerate her remains on July 23/24, 2012. In spite of this strong connection between the time period when The Eliminator was obtained, prepared, and used in relation to the Babcock murder, the text messages at this same time also connect the incinerator to the eventual murder of Bosma some ten months later. In this regard, on July 9, 2012 Millard texted Smich, “BBQ is last piece of the 3500 puzzle. July mission”. Smich replied, “I like BBQ. And I like 3500”. The term “BBQ” was used by the two accused to describe the incinerator and the term “3500” was used to describe the plan to steal a Dodge 3500 truck.

[35]           Although the above factual connection exists, between the 2012 plan to murder Laura Babcock and the further plan that eventually became the Bosma murder some ten months later, in 2013, I am not persuaded that there is a sufficient connection to justify concurrent sentences. The broader conspiracy between Millard and Smich, involving guns, various crimes, and killing, appears to have been loosely defined. It is unclear to me when this broad general conspiracy crystalized and when its various objects became settled, assuming its objects moved from the general to the specific at some point. The Bosma murder plan appears not to have crystalized until many months after the Babcock murder. Most of the facts relating to the Bosma murder are not before me and neither of the two accused have submitted that I can or should make a finding of fact to the effect that the two murders of Babcock and Bosma were part of a single conspiracy that was already in existence in July 2012. In any event, I am not prepared to make that finding on the record before me.

[36]           For all the above reasons, I am satisfied that the two murders of Laura Babcock and Tim Bosma are sufficiently separate and distinct to justify consecutive sentences, on the basis of ordinary common law and Part XXIII Criminal Code principles of sentencing. Indeed, this is an easy and overwhelmingly justified determination, in my view. The more difficult issue in this case is whether the imposition of consecutive sentences would offend the “totality principle” by resulting in a total sentence that is “unduly long or harsh”. This, in turn, raises the subsidiary issue of whether s. 745.51 permits part of the mandatory 25 year period of parole ineligibility to be concurrent and part to be consecutive.

[37]           In relation to this latter issue, Ms. Cameron submits on behalf of the Crown that the s. 745(a) sentence for first degree murder is mandatory and permits no discretion. The new s. 745.51 discretion, in her submission, only allows the trial judge to decide whether that mandatory s. 745(a) sentence is to be consecutive or concurrent. Ms. Cameron further submits that a total sentence of life imprisonment with a 50 year period of parole ineligibility is the fit and appropriate sentence for these two murders, in any event. Mr. Dungey, on behalf of Smich, submits that the s. 745.51 statutory language is unclear and that I can make part of the sentence consecutive and part concurrent, in order to fashion an individualized total sentence that is not “unduly long or harsh”. In this regard, Mr. Dungey submits that Smich played a lesser role than Millard in the Babcock murder and that his moral culpability is thereby reduced. Mr. Pillay, on behalf of Millard, agrees with the Crown that s. 745.51 does not permit part of the sentence to be consecutive and part to be concurrent. He went on to forcefully submit that a life sentence, with a 50 year period of parole ineligibility, was unjustified and would offend ordinary principles of sentencing by extinguishing any hope of Millard’s reform and rehabilitation.

[38]           There is no authority to date as to whether s. 745.51 permits an order that part of the 25 year parole ineligibility period for first degree murder should be served consecutively and part should be served concurrently. I agree with the Crown and Mr. Pillay that the plain meaning of the statutory provision and the statutory scheme does not permit this result. Section 745.51 states that the trial judge must decide whether “the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction are to be served consecutively”. Those “periods without eligibility for parole” are set out in s. 745. The period for first degree murder in s. 745(a) is mandatory and admits of no discretion. If a court concludes that consecutive sentences should be imposed, but then makes only part of the mandatory 25 year period of ineligibility consecutive, the court would be altering the mandatory s. 745(a) sentence. Furthermore, there is nothing in the language of s. 745.51 that refers to “part of the periods without eligibility for parole”.

[39]           As a result, the only two sentences that the statutory scheme permits in this case are life imprisonment with consecutive periods of parole ineligibility totaling 50 years or life imprisonment with concurrent periods of parole ineligibility totaling 25 years. I have already concluded that consecutive sentences can readily be justified in this case, given the lack of any sufficient connection between the two murders. The remaining and more difficult issue is whether 50 years of parole ineligibility, which is the result of consecutive sentences, is “unduly long or harsh” and offends the “totality principle”. If so, then the only alternative is to impose concurrent sentences that result in 25 years of parole ineligibility.

[40]           These are stark alternatives. Parliament may wish to consider amending s. 745.51, to permit part of the 25 year mandatory period of parole ineligibility for first degree murder to be served concurrently, and part to be served consecutively. In that way, the sentences available to trial judges in the case of multiple first degree murders would be somewhat more flexible. In the absence of such an amendment, the issue before me is whether 50 years of parole ineligibility is just and appropriate in this case or whether it is harsh and excessive.

[41]           Turning to that issue, the determination as to whether a sentence is “just and appropriate” or “harsh and excessive” turns on the application of the principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718, 718.1, and 718.2. The most fundamental principle of sentencing, as expressed s. 718.1, is that “a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”. LeBel J., giving the judgement of six members of the Court in R. v. Ipeelee (2012) 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), 280 C.C.C. (3d) 265 at paras. 36-37 (S.C.C.), explained both the importance and the meaning of “proportionality”, as follows:

The fundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence must be proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. As this Court has previously indicated, this principle was not borne out of the 1996 amendments to the Code but, instead, has long been a central tenet of the sentencing process (see e.g. R. v. Wilmott 1966 CanLII 222 (ON CA), [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171 (Ont. C.A.), and, more recently, R. v. Solowan (2008) 2008 SCC 62 (CanLII), 237 C.C.C. (3d) 129, at para. 12 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Nasogaluak (2010) 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), 251 C.C.C. (3d) 293 at paras. 40-42 (S.C.C.). It also has a constitutional dimension, in that s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms forbids the imposition of a grossly disproportionate sentence that would outrage society’s standards of decency. In a similar vein, proportionality in sentencing could aptly be described as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter.

The fundamental principle of sentencing (i.e. proportionality) is intimately tied to the fundamental purpose of sentencing – the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society through the imposition of just sanctions. Whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the various objectives and other principles listed in the Code, the resulting sentence must respect the fundamental principle of proportionality. Proportionality is the sine qua non of a just sanction. First, the principle ensures that a sentence reflects the gravity of the offence. This is closely tied to the objective of denunciation. It promotes justice for victims and ensures public confidence in the justice system. As Wilson J. expressed in her concurring judgment in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, (1985) 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.):

It is basic to any theory of punishment that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a “fit” sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender “deserved” the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system.

Second, the principle of proportionality ensures that a sentence does not exceed what is appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or restraining function and ensures justice for the offender. In the Canadian criminal system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other.

[42]           Doherty J.A.’s reasons on behalf of the Court in R. v. Hamilton (2004) 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at paras. 88-93 (Ont. C.A.) also contain a helpful explanation of the two aspects of “proportionality” that LeBel J. was to reiterate some eight years later in Ipeelee. Doherty J.A. stated:

The case-specific nature of the sentencing inquiry is reflected in the proportionality requirement, described as the fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code:

718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

The proportionality requirement, long a touchstone of Canadian sentencing law (see R. v. Wilmott, 1966 CanLII 222 (ON CA), [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171 at 178-79, (Ont. C.A.)), accepts the “just deserts” rationale for state-imposed punishment. Whatever other ends a sentence may hope to achieve, it must first and foremost fit the specific crime and the specific offender: Andrew Ashworth, Sentencing and Criminal Justice, 2nd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1995) at 70.

The “gravity of the offence” refers to the seriousness of the offence in a generic sense as reflected by the potential penalty imposed by Parliament and any specific features of the commission of the crime which may tend to increase or decrease the harm or risk of harm to the community occasioned by the offence. For example, in drug importation cases, the nature and quantity of the drug involved will impact on the gravity of the offence. Some of the factors which increase the gravity of the offence are set out in s. 718.2(a).

The “degree of responsibility of the offender” refers to the offender’s culpability as reflected in the essential substantive elements of the offence – especially the fault component – and any specific aspects of the offender’s conduct or background that tend to increase or decrease the offender’s personal responsibility for the crime. In drug importation cases, the offender’s role in the importation scheme will be an important consideration in assessing the offender’s personal responsibility.

In R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) at 297-98, Rosenberg J.A. described the proportionality requirement in this way:

The principle of proportionality is rooted in notions of fairness and justice. For the sentencing court to do justice to the particular offender, the sentence imposed must reflect the seriousness of the offence, the degree of culpability of the offender, and the harm occasioned by the offence. The court must have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in the particular case. Careful adherence to the proportionality principle ensures that this offender is not unjustly dealt with for the sake of the common good. [Footnotes omitted].

Fixing a sentence that is consistent with s. 718.1 is particularly difficult where the gravity of the offence points strongly in one sentencing direction and the culpability of the individual offender points strongly in a very different sentencing direction. The sentencing judge must fashion a disposition from among the limited options available which take both sides of the proportionality inquiry into account. As indicated in Priest, supra, factors which may accentuate the gravity of the crime cannot blind the trial judge to factors mitigating personal responsibility. Equally, factors mitigating personal responsibility cannot justify a disposition that unduly minimizes the seriousness of the crime committed. [Emphasis added].

[43]           Applying the above principles to the present case, there are a number of considerations or factors supporting the view that a total sentence of life imprisonment with 50 years parole ineligibility would be a proportionate sentence. In particular, the following eight factors considered cumulatively suggest that result:

•        first, the offence of first degree murder is the most serious offence in the Criminal Code and it carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with 25 years of parole ineligibility. It has been held, in R. v. Luxton (1990) 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), that this mandatory sentence does not violate ss. 7, 9, or 12 of the Charter because it is a proportionate sentence. Lamer C.J.C. reasoned, on behalf of the majority in Luxton, that the mandatory sentence “demonstrates a proportionality between the moral turpitude of the offender and the malignity of the offence” because it provides for “punishment of the most serious crime in our criminal law, that of first degree murder… a crime that carries with it the most serious level of moral blameworthiness, namely, subjective foresight of death”;

•        second, the particular kind of first degree murder in this case was one based on “planning and deliberation”, contrary to s. 231(2). It was not a constructive first degree murder, contrary so s. 231(5)(e), as was the case in Luxton. It has been held that this added element of “planning and deliberation” increases the “moral culpability” of the offence and makes it “the most reprehensible of violent crimes”. In R. v. Droste (1984) 1984 CanLII 68 (SCC), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 404 at 415 (S.C.C.), Dickson J., as he then was, stated: “The rationale behind s. 214(2) [now s. 231(2)] is that there is an added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and deliberate which justifies a harsher sentence. The added culpability is present by virtue of the planning and deliberation with relation to the taking of a human life”. In R. v. Nygaard (1989) 1989 CanLII 6 (SCC), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 435 (S.C.C.), Cory J. gave the majority judgement and stated: “Throughout history the idea that one human being could cold-bloodedly plan and deliberate upon the killing of another has been repugnant to all civilized societies and has tended to be considered as the most reprehensible of violent crimes”. [Emphasis added];

•        third, in this case the two accused planned and deliberated on the murder of Laura Babcock over an extended period of time during April, May, June and July of 2012. After committing that first murder, they proceeded to plan and deliberate again, this time in relation to the murder of Tim Bosma. This deliberate repetition of the “most reprehensible” crime with its “added moral culpability” merits separate punishment, in order to achieve the sentencing objectives of denunciation and retribution. In this regard, see R. v. C.A.M. (1996) 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 at paras. 40-42 and 77-81 (S.C.C.) where Lamer C.J.C.,  speaking on behalf of the unanimous full Court, extensively discussed retribution and denunciation, as sentencing objectives, and their relationship to the requirement of proportionality. In particular, he stated:

Retribution in a criminal context… represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate punishment which properly reflects the moral culpability of the offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender, the consequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character of the offender’s conduct. Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution incorporates a principle of restraint; retribution requires the imposition of a just and appropriate punishment, and nothing more. As R. Cross has noted in The English Sentencing System, 2nd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1975), at p. 121: “The retributivist insists that the punishment must not be disproportionate to the offender’s deserts”.

Retribution, as well, should be conceptually distinguished from its legitimate sibling, denunciation. Retribution requires that a judicial sentence properly reflect the moral blameworthiness of that particular offender. The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society’s condemnation of that particular offender’s conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law. As Lord Justice Lawton stated in R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 74 at p. 77; “society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the court can show this is by the sentences they pass”. The relevance of both retribution and denunciation as goals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justice system is not simply a vast system of negative penalties designed to prevent objectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost the offender must bear in committing an enumerated offence. Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code. [Italics of Lamer C.J.C.].

In order to achieve the above sentencing objectives of denunciation and retribution, in relation to the deliberate repetition of the separate and distinct murders of Laura Babcock and then of Tim Bosma, a separate consecutive sentence is arguably required. It is the “moral blameworthiness” involved in repeating the offence, and “society’s condemnation” of the repetition of the offence, that both tend to require separate consecutive sentences;

•        fourth, this repetition of two planned and deliberate murders also arguably requires separate punishment in order to deter potential serial murderers who are thinking about going on to commit a second murder, after having successfully completed a first murder. In this regard, the Supreme Court of Canada has made two significant pronouncements concerning the relationship between deterrence and murder sentences. First, in R. v. Shropshire, supra at para. 21, Iacobucci J. stated the following on behalf of the Court:

“Deterrence” is also a relevant criterion in justifying a s. 744 order. Parole eligibility informs the content of the “punishment” meted out to an offender: for example, there is a very significant difference between being behind bars and functioning within society while on conditional release. Consequently, I believe that lengthened periods of parole ineligibility could reasonably be expected to deter some person from reoffending. Such is also the position of a variety of provincial appellate courts. [Emphasis added, citations omitted].

Second, in R. v. Latimer (2001) 2001 SCC 1 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 86 (S.C.C.), the unanimous Court stated the following:

Furthermore, denunciation becomes much more important in the consideration of sentencing in cases where there is a “high degree of planning and premeditation, and where the offence and its consequences are highly publicized, [so that] like-minded individuals may well be deterred by severe sentences”: R. v. Mulvahill and Snelgrove (1993), 21 B.C.A.C. 296 at p. 300. This is particularly so where the victim is a vulnerable person with respect to age, disability, or other similar factors. [Emphasis added].

In both the Babcock case and the Bosma case, there was substantial “planning and premeditation”, and both trials were “highly publicized”. In these circumstances, deterrence of other “like-minded” serial murderers, who will probably have to engage in their own planning and premeditation, is both critically important (in order to hopefully prevent more murders) and it may well be effective (given that even skeptics of deterrence theory agree that it can be effective in cases that involve both premeditation of the offence and publicity about the likely sentence). In order to achieve the above sentencing objective - deterrence of other serial murderers - in relation to the separate and distinct murders of Laura Babcock and Tim Bosma, a separate consecutive sentence is arguably required;

•        fifth, there are a number of aggravating circumstances in the present case. I have already mentioned the extensive planning and deliberation and the repetition of the offence. In addition, the incineration of Ms. Babcock’s remains, the photographing of that incineration (as some kind of memorable event or trophy), Smich’s triumphal and happy posing at the scene of the incineration, Smich’s boastful celebration of the murder in a song that he composed and proudly performed for friends, and Millard’s post-offence attempts to obstruct justice with Ms. Noudga, are all aggravating in my view. A number of these added features of the case have caused, and will likely continue to cause, unremitting suffering to the Babcock family;

•        sixth, the mitigating features relied on by both accused, to try to reduce their moral culpability, are not persuasive. Millard unsuccessfully attempted to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a good side to his personality and that his eventual reform and rehabilitation should be encouraged by imposing a concurrent sentence. In my view, Millard is skillful and clever in deploying pro-social behaviour when it is to his advantage. The overwhelming weight of evidence, from his text messages and from his criminal conduct, is that he is profoundly amoral and dangerous. Smich undoubtedly did not have all the advantages of Millard’s privileged upbringing. Nevertheless, Smich had a mother and two older sisters who loved him and who provided for him. His motivation, in committing these two murders with Millard, is complex. It is tied up with his apparently determined efforts to adopt a gangster persona and with his adherence to a broader general criminal conspiracy with Millard. What is clear is that Smich was enthusiastically involved in the murder of Laura Babcock, both before and after its commission. I cannot make findings about his exact role, one way or the other, but he was never reluctant. I am satisfied that he was pleased and enthusiastic to be a participant with Millard in the murder. In short, there is nothing about either Millard or Smich that could reduce or mitigate their moral culpability. Most of the other factors set out above actually increase their moral culpability;

•        seventh, the jury’s recommendation is unanimous and unequivocal in relation to Millard, namely, that he should receive the “maximum consecutive” sentence. In relation to Smich, the jury was ambivalent as five jurors recommended a “maximum consecutive” sentence and seven made no recommendation. This differentiation between the two accused likely reflects the fact that Millard was the leader and Smich was more of a follower. However, as noted previously, Smich was an enthusiastic follower with complex motivations of his own. The mandatory s. 745(a) sentence for first degree murder does not differentiate between the leader and the enthusiastic follower, like Smich, who willingly and happily assists and encourages the leader. They both receive the same sentence, pursuant to s. 745(a), because the very high gravity of the offence and the willingness to assist in such an offence tend to dominate the assessment of “proportionality”; and

•        eighth, considerations of parity, as required by s. 718.2(b), tend to argue in favour of consecutive sentences. There is no appellate jurisprudence, applying and interpreting s. 745.51, at this early stage of its history. However, there are 13 Canadian trial decisions. In nine of these cases, consecutive sentences have been imposed, and in four of the cases concurrent sentences have been imposed. The latter group of four cases all involved two counts of second degree murder, the periods of parole ineligibility were increased in each case (to 22 years, 18 years, 22 years, and 18 years), and the sentences were then made concurrent. In three of these cases, the two murders occurred on the same day and were arguably part of the same transaction. In the fourth case, there were guilty pleas and a joint submission. All of these cases are less serious than the case at bar and are easily distinguishable. See: R. v. Koopmans, 2015 BCSC 2120; R. v. Rushton, 2016 NSSC 313; R. v. Sharpe, 2017 MBQB 6; R. v. Bains, 2015 BCSC 2145. The group of nine cases, where consecutive sentences were imposed, were all serious. Some involved horrific facts, some involved significant danger to the public, and some involved three murders. However, in some of the cases there were guilty pleas and in some of the cases the multiple murders all occurred on the same day and were arguably part of the same transaction. In some of the cases, there was no planning and deliberation and the convictions were for second degree murder. In all of the cases, lengthy total periods of consecutive parole ineligibility were imposed (30 years for two second degree murders at the bottom end of the range and 75 years for three first degree murders at the top end of the range). See: R. v. Husbands [2015] O.J. No. 2674 (S.C.J.), reversed on other grounds, 2017 ONCA 607; R. v. Clorina, 2015 ABQB 252; R. v. Baumgartner, 2013 ABQB 761; R. v. Vuozzo, 2015 PESC 14; R. v. Bourque, 2014 NBQB 237; R. v. Ostamas, 2016 MBQB 136; R. v. Saretzky, 2017 ABQB 496; R. v. Garland, 2017 ABQB 198; R. v. Borutski, 2017 ONSC 7762. The case at bar is much closer to this group of consecutive sentence cases than it is to the concurrent sentence cases. It is also more serious than the cases at the 30 to 40 year bottom end of the range, which involved second degree murders, guilty pleas, and/or psychiatric mental health issues (Husbands, Clorina, Vuozzo, and Baumgartner). However, it is less serious than the cases at the 70 to 75 year top end of the range that all involved three murders (Bourque, Ostamas, Saretzky, Garland, and Borutski). In terms of the parity principle, a 50 year total period of parole ineligibility would accurately situate the present case within the above range established by the existing case law.

[44]           In light of the above eight circumstances, I am satisfied that a sentence of life imprisonment with a 25 year period of parole ineligibility, consecutive to the Bosma murder sentence, is proportionate and just. It is also not “unduly long or harsh”, in light of the above eight circumstances.

[45]           The accused filed a constitutional challenge to s. 745.51, alleging that this new discretion to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility for multiple murders violates ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter of Rights. Mr. Dungey and Mr. Pillay both sensibly agreed not to argue the Charter Motion, given that two judges of this Court have previously dismissed the same Charter argument. The two accused in the present case wish to preserve their right to pursue this issue on appeal. Accordingly, they filed the Motion but they invited me to adopt the rulings made by my two colleagues, Ewaschuk J. in R. v. Husbands [2015] O.J. No. 2673 (S.C.J.) and Campbell J. in R. v. Granados-Arana, 2017 ONSC 6785. I agree that the Charter Motion should be dismissed for the reasons set out in Husbands and in Granados-Arana and for reasons of judicial comity, as explained by Strathy J., as he then was, in R. v. Scarlett, 2013 ONSC 562 at paras. 43-4.
