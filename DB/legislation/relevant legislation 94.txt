IV.            Governing Law
A.   Overview
[135]      In order to place my factual findings in their proper legal context, I will outline the essential elements of the offences of manslaughter, first and second degree murder.

[136]      The Crown must prove all the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt: R v JHS, 2008 SCC 30 at para 9; R v Lifchus, 1997 CanLII 319 (SCC), [1997] 3 SCR 320 at paras 30-31. The standard is not one beyond "any" doubt -- it is not a standard of absolute certainty, the standard is one that excludes all "reasonable" doubts about innocence, doubts that are not mere speculation, or imaginary or frivolous, or based on sympathy or prejudice: Lifchus at para 31.

[137]      Murder is always either first or second degree, and requires proof of conduct, an unlawful act, that causes the victim to die. It is an act or a series of acts done by the accused person(s) which has a sufficiently substantial effect that it can be said to have been the cause of the death.

[138]      It is now well accepted that an act or series of acts causing death can be committed if the conduct consists only of an omission or a series of omissions: R v Bottineau, 2006 CarswellOnt 8510 (ONSC) (Bottineau 2006) at para 13 citing R v Hallet [1969] SASR 141(Australia SC) at 149 (Hallet).  

[139]      The Crown’s case rests on the continuing failure of the Defendants to properly treat their son’s diabetes or seek medical assistance to do so coupled with their failure to seek timely medical care when he became sicker and sicker.

[140]      The Defendants concede that they are guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life for Alex as they were legally obligated to do under s 215(1)(a) and (c) of the Criminal Code. Under s 215(2) (a) and (b), a breach of s 215(1)(a) and (c) is an offence if the failure causes or is likely to cause the delineated consequences described in those sections. Failure to perform such a legal duty, without more, does not establish an unlawful killing. The omissions or series of omissions must be a significant contributing cause of the person’s death before anyone may be called to account for an unlawful killing: Bottineau (2006) at para 15; R v Nette, 2001 SCC 78 at para 72.

[141]      Not every unlawful killing is murder. To prove that an unlawful killing is murder the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person or persons responsible for the death intended to kill the victim or intended to cause the victim harm that the perpetrator knew would cause death or be reckless as to whether death ensued. Where the act or conduct on the part of the perpetrator that causes the death is an omission or series of omissions then the intent to kill must coincide at some point with the omission that causes death Bottineau (2006) at para 16; R v Cooper, 1993 CanLII 147 (SCC), [1993] 1 SCR 146 at 161.

[142]      Murder is either first or second degree as per s 231(1). The Criminal Code provides a number of bases on which a person may be found guilty of first degree murder. A planned and deliberate murder is first degree murder as per s 231(2) of the Criminal Code. A murder committed while unlawfully confining the victim or attempting to confine the victim is also first degree murder per s 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code.

[143]      The Crown’s case  is that Mr. and Mrs. Radita as joint principals unlawfully caused the death of Alex Radita by failing to provide him with the necessaries of life, that being insulin and medical attention. The length of time their failure continued gives rise to the strong inference that his parents intended to kill him or intended to cause him bodily harm that they knew would likely kill him or were reckless whether he did or did not die. Further the Crown’s position is that the Raditas are guilty of first degree murder because Alex’s death was planned and deliberate or occurred while both of them unlawfully confined their son.
