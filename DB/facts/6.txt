Evidence of S.N.
[4]               S.N. knew Mr. Navia as a neighbour.  At the time of trial she did not know his last name.  He lives approximately five houses from her house and he had been a neighbour for about nine years.  She described him as a general acquaintance whom she would run into from time to time on the neighbourhood street, particularly when she was taking her two children to school.  She saw him infrequently during the summer of 2018.

[5]               She and her family were planning to take a vacation in another province and she had asked Mr. Navia to check on the family cat and water the outside flowers.  A couple of days before August 2, 2018, Mr. Navia had come over to the house.  S.N.’s husband and her two children were present at the time.  The purpose of Mr. Navia’s visit was so she could give him the house key and to go over what to do with the cat and the flowers.

[6]               S.N. worked part-time and was at home on Thursday, August 2, 2018 with her two daughters aged 8 and 5.  She had decided to take them to an amusement park.  Her kids were dressed and S.N., who was in her pajamas, had gone upstairs to get dressed.

[7]               Her children were downstairs on the main level of the house.  The house doors were locked.  She did not hear a knock or doorbell ring but, while she was putting away laundry upstairs, she could hear her children speaking to someone, and then her oldest daughter called out “Mom, Rodrigo is here”.

[8]               S.N. started down the stairs and Mr. Navia was already on the stairs, about five stairs up, ascending the second level of her house.  S.N. was alarmed to find him there.  S.N.’s oldest daughter was standing partially between her and Mr. Navia.  S.N. felt scared but did not want to alarm her children.  She stretched her arms out to block Mr. Navia from going further.  As he said hello he started rubbing S.N.’s right hip with his hand.  He then swung his hand around and started rubbing the right side of her buttocks.  Her eight year old daughter was standing to the left side of S.N.  She felt she needed to get Mr. Navia down the stairs and keep the situation calm.

[9]               She said she “kind of ran past” Mr. Navia.  At the same time her five year old daughter had come from another room and her two daughters followed her.  She told Mr. Navia they had plans to go out and it was time for him to leave.  However, he made no movement towards the door but stayed in the house.  They ended up in the kitchen, with Mr. Navia on one side of the kitchen island and her on the other.  Her children spoke to Mr. Navia in Spanish as they were both attending a Spanish speaking school.  At one point, Mr. Navia grabbed S.N.’s eight year old’s daughter’s face with both hands, and started saying she is so beautiful, with his face right up to her face.  S.N. felt uncomfortable with this and grabbed a picture of her husband’s parents as her oldest daughter looks like her husband’s mother.  She shoved the picture in Mr. Navia’s hands so he would take his hands off of her daughter.  S.N. did not want to alert her daughter to the fact this was a scary situation.  She had no idea what Mr. Navia was going to do or whether he might have a weapon.

[10]           She recalls he had a camera that he pulled out and he started taking pictures of her youngest daughter who was laying on the carpet petting the cat.

[11]           She recalls at one point, Mr. Navia started to come towards her around the kitchen island.  She pulled open the dishwasher door to block him from coming further towards her.  She was scared and at the same time she was starting to get mad because he was not leaving.  She finally said to the girls “Get your coats on. Grab your shoes we are going to go to the amusement park.”

[12]           She recalled her children putting their shoes on and running out to the front yard.  She recalls the front door being open at this point.  The children asked if they could walk Mr. Navia home, and she said “No, you’re not walking him home”.  The front door was open and she recalls him standing at the front door and she was hanging on to the bannister of her stairs which are near the front door entrance.  She recalls wanting to put something between her and Mr. Navia.  While her two daughters were outside, he closed the door but did not latch it.  She felt scared.  Her reaction was to immediately go towards the door to get the door open.  Mr. Navia then came towards her.  S.N. was wearing a long tank top that covered her buttocks and a pair of pajama bottoms and a zip up hoodie.  She says Mr. Navia very quickly shoved his hand up her tank top and then shoved his hand back down underneath her pajama bottoms and rubbed her bare buttocks, as she was not wearing any underwear.  At the same time, he kissed her on the lips.  Mr. Navia smokes and afterwards she could smell cigarette smoke on her.

[13]           She shoved him and took a step back.  At that moment, her eight year old daughter pushed open the front door.  She recalls her daughter saying “What’s going on?  Why are you crying mom?  Are you guys coming, what’s going on?”.  S.N. said she was trying not to alert her children to what was happening.  She recalls Mr. Navia grabbing the door and telling her daughter “I’m just talking to your mom. You go, you shoo.”  She managed to grab the door above his head, push it open and jump out onto the front step with her daughters.  She said to Mr. Navia “It’s time for you to go now.”  She was now on the front steps and Mr. Navia was still in the entry way of her house and would not come out.  Both of her children were saying “Come on, what’s going on? Let’s go.”

[14]           Her eight year old daughter then asked again if they could walk Mr. Navia home.  Mr. Navia had a key to her house.  She was afraid he would come back into the house.  She did not know what to do.  She was wearing pajamas and her children were wondering why they were not going to the amusement park.  She said to her children they could walk Mr. Navia home.  She did this so she could buy time to get her pants on, and that when her children returned she could just get into the vehicle and leave with them.  She said her brain was “going a million miles an hour”.

[15]           As they left, she ran upstairs, pulled on a pair of pants and then “raced” to her front door.  When she got to her front door she said her heart sank when she did not see her children.  She ran down the street and very firmly knocked on Mr. Navia’s door several times and rang the door bell several times.  She did not have her cell phone with her.  She then started to run back to her house where she was going to call the police.  When she got to the end of Mr. Navia’s driveway the front door of Mr. Navia’s house opened, and her eight year old daughter was there saying “Mom, mom, we’re here, we’re right here, what’s wrong?”.  She then went back to Mr. Navia’s front steps and said “Get out here right now, I did not give you permission to go into his house and we are leaving.”  She said she started to walk back to her place but out of her peripheral vision she saw Mr. Navia come to his door.  She said he watched her and her children walk back to her house.  She then immediately got into her vehicle and left for the day until her husband came home.  She called the police that night.

[16]           She testified Mr. Navia was in her house for at least half an hour if not closer to forty-five minutes.

[17]           In cross-examination she agreed Mr. Navia was older.  She is 5’ 10”.  She did not agree that he had shaking hands, but when he touched her, she noticed his hand shaking a bit.

[18]           She said when he had come over a couple days earlier she had indicated to him she would leave written instructions on the counter.  She had asked him to come on Sunday as she and her family were leaving on Saturday.  She confirmed Mr. Navia had, on the earlier visit, told her that he had never looked after a cat, and she had offered to leave him written instructions.

[19]           She reiterated that when she came down the stairs from the second floor, Mr. Navia was coming up the stairs, and was about on the fifth step.  When she saw Mr. Navia, she did not ask him to stop or to get off of the stairs or to leave her house or to return the key that had been given to him.  She said she simply stepped back and described her brain as going “a mile a minute”.  She was trying to get out of the situation safely with her children.

[20]           She denied suggestions from the Defence that Mr. Navia was never on the stairs and that he never touched her in the way she described.  She does not recall him ever saying he was there to receive instructions on the care of the cat.  She does recall him saying he was there for a visit.  She denies ever inviting him into the house.  She was certain Mr. Navia was in the house for approximately 30 – 45 minutes.  She denied Mr. Navia was only at the house for 10 – 15 minutes.

[21]           She said after her children left with Mr. Navia to walk him to his house she ran inside to put on her pants.  She estimated it took her about three to three and a half minutes to do this and then she went to her front door to see if she could see her children.  When she could not see them, she grabbed her shoes and ran onto the sidewalk and when she could not see her children in his driveway or on the sidewalk she started walking very quickly, almost running, to his house.  She said it was only a few minutes, perhaps a couple of minutes, that elapsed between when she first went to her front door to look for her children and when she arrived at the door of Mr. Navia’s house.

Evidence of Mr. Navia
[22]           Mr. Navia is 69 years old and is an electrical engineer.  His wife died in October 2013.  He lives alone.  He is 5 foot 4 inches and weighs 69 kilograms.  He has a number of health issues including a heart condition that required bypass surgery in 2008.  He testified he has a micro vascular condition in his hands and feet which causes his hands to get inflamed and shake.  He suffered from this condition in August 2018.  A portion of a report prepared by Dr. McMillan, dated June 12, 2019, was admitted in evidence with the consent of the Crown.  The report noted that Mr. Navia suffers from a postural tremor.

[23]           Mr. Navia testified that due to his age and heart conditions and other ailments he has a slow gait when he walks.

[24]           He testified he would see S.N. only on occasion and described her as an acquaintance.  He has known S.N. for about nine years.  Her house was five houses from his and it would take him around five minutes to walk from his house to her house.

[25]           He went to her house at about 10:30 a.m. on August 2, 2018.  He wanted to get written instructions on how to care for the cat as he had never taken care of a cat before.  At the time, his son I.N. was at his house organizing for a marathon that he was going to run.  He told his son he was going to go to the neighbour’s house and that he would be “right back”.

[26]           When he got to S.N.’s house the main door was open but a screen door was in place.  The eldest daughter was at the door behind the screen and yelled to her mom that Mr. Navia was there.  Mr. Navia was still outside the house.  He said S.N. came to the door and invited him in.  He can’t recall whether it was the daughter or S.N. who opened the screen.  He says he did not ring the doorbell or knock on the door.  When he got inside the house S.N. told him they were in a rush because they were going to the park.  S.N. was wearing dark yoga pants and a long-sleeved light sweater.  She was not in pajamas.  He went to an area near the kitchen and stood on the opposite side of S.N., who was on the other side of the kitchen island.  S.N. was preparing snacks.  He had a discussion with S.N. about their travel plans.  While this was discussion was occurring, S.N.’s two daughters were running around near him.  They were watching videos and they showed him a video of an event at school involving folk dancing.

[27]           At the moment he was leaving the house he asked for the instructions on the cat.  S.N. told him she would leave the written instructions on the kitchen counter.

[28]           He stayed at the house no more than seven minutes.  As he was leaving the daughters asked S.N. if they could walk with Mr. Navia to his house.  He said he had told the children about his son and they wanted to meet his son.  The children asked their mom if they could go with him.  S.N. said yes but they were to come back quickly.  They then walked to Mr. Navia’s home.  When they got to the house he opened the door and the girls came inside and took their shoes off.  He took them upstairs to introduce the children to his son.  They then quickly left because his son was busy.

[29]           They went back downstairs and he gave a doll to the older daughter who had shown him the folk dances in the video.  At that moment, S.N. was standing at the door and she asked the girls to leave with her.  She didn’t ring the doorbell because the door was wide open.  He said the girls stayed in his house for maybe two minutes.  When S.N. came to the door she was wearing the same clothes she had on when he was at her house.

[30]           He denied going up the stairs towards the second floor of S.N.’s house.  He denied he had cameras with him when he was at S.N.’s house or taking any photographs.  He denied putting both hands on S.N.’s daughter’s face and saying that she was beautiful.  He denied kissing S.N. or touching her in any way.

[31]           In cross-examination, Mr. Navia acknowledged he lives alone, and in August 2018, he was able to cook, clean, bathe and carry out normal daily activities.  He also acknowledged owning two cameras.  He continues to use both cameras, although he uses the larger Canon camera as it has an anti-shaking feature.  He can press the shutter button to take a photo.  He stated the tremors in his hands would not have been worse in 2018 than they were when he saw Dr. McMillan in 2019.

[32]           He had known S.N. and her family for about nine years.  Their interactions were friendly and that there were no ill feelings between him and S.N. before August 2, 2018, he believed S.N. and her family trusted him as that was the reason they asked him to care for their cat.  He acknowledged he had been given oral instructions a couple of days earlier but he described it as a quick explanation without details.

[33]           He was asked about watching the videos shown to him by S.N.’s oldest daughter.  He said there were two or three videos and they were “minutes long”.  When he left S.N.’s house the children were outside.  He denies he was still inside with S.N. or that he tried to shut the door once the children were outside.

[34]           He was asked about getting written instructions on caring for the cat.  He said he told the eldest daughter when he first arrived that he was coming for instructions.  He did not ask for written instructions from S.N. until the end of his visit when he was leaving.

[35]           In re-examination, Mr. Navia indicated he had received oral instructions from S.N. on caring for the cat two days earlier.  He said he needed to get written instructions because he has no experience with cats and it was a big responsibility to care for the cat.

Evidence by I.N.
[36]           I.N. is Mr. Navia’s son.  He is 33 years old and has lived in Calgary for 19 years.  He lived with his father from 2012 to 2017.  On the morning of August 2, 2018, he went to his father’s place to prepare for a trail running race.  He had all of his gear at his father’s.  He went to the second floor TV room and started working on getting his gear set up for the race.  While he was doing this his dad was outside in the front yard pulling weeds and working on the flower beds.  At around 10:00 a.m., Mr. Navia came in and told him he was going to the neighbour’s house to get instructions for feeding the cat and watering their plants, as he was going to take care of their house while they were away.

[37]           Around 10-15 minutes later, he heard the door open downstairs and a few seconds later two little girls came into the TV room.  He said his father came up behind them and told him that they were the neighbour’s daughters.  They were curious about the race he was going to do and so he showed them all the gear that he had laid out on the floor.  The interaction with the daughters did not last more than a minute or two before they went downstairs with his father behind them.  Before they left he did not hear any doorbell or knocking on the door or any voices.  From his position in the TV room he had a view of the driveway, and he could see his father working on the lawn again and pulling weeds.  He described his father’s demeanour as calm and just going about his day, the same as he was before he went to S.N.’s house.

[38]           In cross-examination, I.N. said that on August 2, 2018 his father could carry out the daily activities needed to care for himself and could weed his lawn.

[39]           When he was in the TV room the window was open and he would be able to hear any conversation or other activity around the front door.  He did not hear the girls before they came up to the TV room nor did he hear the voice of a women while he was in the room.

Position of the Defence
[40]           The complainant and the accused gave different versions of what occurred at S.N.’s house on August 2, 2018. Mr. Navia denies kissing or touching S.N. The fundamental issue is credibility.

[41]           The defence referred to R v F(S), 2007 PESCAD 17, (“F(S)”), R v McClenaghan, 2010 ABCA 222, (“McClenaghan”), R v CWH (1991), 1991 CanLII 3956 (BC CA), 68 CCC (3d) 146 (BCCA), (“CWH”), R v KHT, 2017 ABQB 753, (“KHT”), R v Ryon, 2019 ABCA 36, 371 CCC (3d) 225, (“Ryon”), R v Jensen, 2018 ABPC 105, (“Jensen”).  The cases referenced by the Defence elucidate the application of R v W(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 SCR 742, (“W(D)”), and I have considered all of them.

[42]           The Defence argues there is no reason not to believe Mr. Navia.  He left the protection of the dock and testified to what he did and did not do.  His demeanour was earnest and forthright. He was not impeached on cross-examination. He is an un-sophisticated witness. He has never been accused of a crime and never testified in court.  He is nearly 70 and English is not his first language.  His denials are not “outlandish” or “impossible to accept”

[43]           By contrast, there were significant discrepancies in the complaint’s evidence. She testified Mr. Navia was at her house for 30-45 minutes. Mr. Navia said he was there for no more than seven minutes. His evidence is consistent with I.N.’s evidence that his father was gone for no more than 10-15 minutes.

[44]           S.N. testified the when she went to get her children from Mr. Navia’s house, the door was closed.  She knocked and rang the doorbell.  Mr. Navia said he left the door open. I.N. who was in an upstairs room, that had an open archway to the downstairs, denied hearing a door knock or bell.

[45]           The contradictions in the complainant’s testimony with the evidence of Mr. Navia and I.N. should indicate to the court the Crown’s evidence is not reliable. The Defence refers to F(S) that “A conviction can only come about if the Crown evidence is so reliable, so consistent and so believable that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.  There must be no other reasonable conclusion from the evidence”. (paragraph 31)

[46]           In brief, the Defence argues there is no reason to reject Mr. Navia’s evidence. At the very least, the Court should have a reasonable doubt about whether to believe such evidence.

[47]           Given the inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony, it is not so “convincing, consistent and indubitably reliable” (KHT para 86) that the Crown has proved the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

Position of the Crown
[48]           The Crown argues Mr. Navia’s evidence is implausible and internally inconsistent, and in looking at Mr. Navia’s testimony in the context of the evidence as a whole, it is neither believable nor does it raise a reasonable doubt.

[49]           The explanation given for going to S.N.’s house is implausible.  Mr. Navia said he went to get instructions for the care of the cat. He had been given oral instructions a couple of days earlier.  He says he came to get written instructions.  But, on his evidence he didn’t ask S.N. for those instructions until he was leaving.

[50]           He allowed the children to go into his house, remove their shoes and go the second floor, even though he testified S.N. had told her children to come back quickly.

[51]           He testified S.N. just appeared at the front door of her house, but could not testify whether she came from the hallway or the stairs, even though he said that when he arrived only the screen door was in place, and he could see S.N.’s daughter inside the house.

[52]           S.N.’s testimony was forthright, concise and clear.  It was not undermined in cross-examination.  The evidence is so compelling that when the evidence of Mr. Navia and I.N. are considered in the context of the whole of the evidence it is not believable nor does it raise a reasonable doubt.
