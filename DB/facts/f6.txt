Background

[5]            A homicide, the death of someone caused by another individual, can be culpable or non-culpable. A culpable homicide is murder, manslaughter or infanticide.  Culpable homicide is murder where an individual who causes the death of another person does so with one of two states of mind: either with an intention (1) to cause death, or (2) to cause bodily harm that they know is likely to cause death while being reckless whether death follows.

[6]            Both accused, Mr. Sparks and Ms. Ritch, were charged with the first degree murder of Nadia Gonzales.  The Crown theory was that Mr. Sparks and Ms. Ritch carried out the murder, and that at the very least Ms. Ritch aided or abetted Mr. Sparks in committing the murder.  There was DNA evidence which linked Mr. Sparks, and to a lesser extent Ms. Ritch, to the murder.

[7]            As the Ontario Court of Appeal discussed in R. v. Wong (2006), 2006 CanLII 18516 (ON CA), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 520, a trial judge must instruct on included offences, depending on the evidence led, the issues raised, and the positions of the parties.  I will go through that analysis.

Calvin Sparks

[8]            Both the Crown and defence agreed that manslaughter should not be left with the jury as a possible verdict with regards to Calvin Sparks.  This was on the basis that the cause of death, some 40 stab wounds to Ms. Gonzales, could not possibly have resulted in a conviction for manslaughter.  There is no air of reality to that verdict.

[9]            Doctor Matthew Bowes gave evidence at trial that the cause of Ms. Gonzales’s death was multiple stab wounds.  Throughout, the defence theory was that a third party suspect committed this homicide, and that Mr. Sparks was not involved.

[10]        The evidence against Mr. Sparks included but was not limited to John Patterson’s evidence concerning Mr. Sparks’ actions at the scene of Ms. Gonzales’s death on June 16, 2017,  and DNA evidence placing Mr. Sparks’ blood at various locations in the hallways of 33 Hastings and in the stairwell where Ms. Gonzales’s body was found in a bag.  His DNA was found on a knife blade and on the bag, including the straps and zipper.

[11]        The evidence was Ms. Gonzales received forty (40) stab wounds including to her right lung and a deep wound to her jugular vein and carotid artery.  Dr. Bowes’s opinion was that Ms. Gonzales’s death was caused by multiple sharp force wounds and that she bled to death.  There were a dozen sharp force injuries to her neck, half a dozen in her upper back, and four to five in her lower back.  Dr. Bowes opined that the injury to her carotid and jugular would have resulted in her death even if it had happened at a hospital, where she would have received immediate medical attention.
