[3]           Yvon Arsenault was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1968. After his first positions in the parish of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, in 1970, he was transferred as a curate to Shediac, where he worked for four years. Upon his arrival, he was 27 years old.

[4]           His duties included acting as chaplain at the Polyvalente L.J. Robichaud high school and, upon request, assisting the catechesis teachers at Saint-Cœur-de-Marie primary elementary school.

[5]           In 1971, the nuns who had occupied a convent near the old Shediac church left the parish. In 1972, the building was decommissioned as a convent and equipped for use as a youth club.

[6]           The youth club, which welcomed boys and girls, was managed by a parents’ committee, the parish committee and the Lions Club. Mr. Arsenault was a member of the committee and the liaison person with the committee of youngsters responsible for the activities at the club. Students from the high school organized and monitored the activities to entertain the youngsters after school and in the evenings until 9 p.m.

[7]           Mr. Arsenault occasionally visited the youth club. The visits allowed him to observe the activities and talk to those in charge, with whom he also had contact at the high school, and report to the committee.

[8]           The former convent was an old three-storey Victorian building. The basement was a large hall with stone walls and a cement floor. The ground floor had originally comprised a meeting room, a sacristy or chapel, a hallway and a bathroom. It was the main floor where the youngsters would go to play cards, do various activities, or play on a small pool table. Upstairs, where the nuns’ bedrooms had been, in one of them, which had probably been the room of Sister Superior, as it was larger, there was a Foosball table where the youngsters would go and play. The other rooms on the second floor were most likely not used by the youngsters. There were also two bathrooms, separated by a wall, with only a toilet and nothing else, as the sink was outside.

[9]           At all material times, R.A., born in 1958, was between twelve and fifteen years old and, after school, would go to the youth club while he was a student at Saint-Cœur-de-Marie school.

[10]        R.A. stated that, at that time, he met Yvon Arsenault at school within the context of the catechesis class when he was in eighth grade. Yvon Arsenault, who had been invited by his teacher, Anita Pellerin, would go and talk to the pupils at school and it was in this context that Mr. Arsenault started rubbing his back, arms and chest.

[11]        After school, he would go to the youth club, where R.A. would see Yvon Arsenault, who was a supervisor.

[12]        R.A. liked Foosball and would go to play with his friends on the second floor. According to him, he would go and play not only with his friends, but often alone because of his great love for Foosball and also because he liked solitude.

[13]        Sometimes, Yvon Arsenault would go to the second floor where R.A. was alone and would continue fondling him, increasingly touching his private parts. At some point, Mr. Arsenault pulled his pants off and, once he was naked, he apparently caressed his penis and his buttocks.

[14]        This event, which lasted one, two or three minutes, ended when R.A. heard someone coming up the stairs to the second floor. R.A. took advantage of the situation to pull up his pants and escape to the ground floor. At the door, he ran into the person coming up the stairs.

[15]        Another time, when R.A. was in the bathroom on the second floor, Yvon Arsenault apparently entered and performed oral sex on him. R.A. put an end to it when he pushed away Yvon Arsenault, who was kneeling down. R.A. escaped after Yvon Arsenault fell to the ground. The oral sex was the last incident involving Yvon Arsenault and R.A.

[16]        The Court also heard and considered that R.A. mentioned during his testimony that he had often had his buttocks and his private parts rubbed in the rooms and bathrooms and that Mr. Arsenault had told him that it was normal and not to tell anyone. In short, these are R.A.’s allegations.

[17]        R.A. never told anyone about these events until October 27, 2016, when he went to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made a written statement to a police officer. It was after the said statement that these proceedings were commenced by the laying of an information. A preliminary inquiry took place on October 19, 2017, and the trial was held on the dates mentioned above.

[18]        At the trial, Yvon Arsenault was called to testify in his defence. He categorically denied the accusations made against him and maintained that he did not know R.A., that he did not remember him in particular and that he did not know his family.
