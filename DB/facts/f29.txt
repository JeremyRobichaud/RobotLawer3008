V.  Factual Backdrop

 

[13]   It is worthwhile to first identify the various parties and provide some background facts.  The complainant was born in late June 1991.  As noted, the Indictment alleges the offences occurred on or between June 1 and September 30, 2000. The complainant’s evidence is that the incident occurred when she was 9, 10 or 11 years of age. The complainant is now in her late 20s.

 

[14]   In summary, the accused and GP are the parents of a daughter, the complainant and a son, MP.  At one point, the family resided in Canoe Cove, Prince Edward Island.  MP recalls his parents separating when he was young and after the separation, MP primarily lived in New Brunswick with his father. There was fairly significant evidence before the court as to whom was living where, and with whom, during the time period set out in the Indictment.  The complainant’s evidence is that at the time of the incident she and her mother were living together at the Canoe Cove property. This is a key issue given the accused’s position that the evidence clearly establishes that neither the complainant, nor the accused, were living the Canoe Cove property during the time period set out in the Indictment.

 

[15]   The complainant had a child, DP in 2012.  Since January of 2014 the accused has had primary care of DP (though DP was removed from the accused’s care during the Child Protection investigation referred to in the Admissions).

 

[16]   In March of 2015, the accused sought an interim order for sole custody of DP and supervised access with the complainant.  In July 2015, the court issued an interim order in granting the accused interim sole custody of DP and supervised access with the complainant.  As noted, the accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching on June 1, 2018.  Child Protection investigated and concluded that no further protection involvement was recommended regarding the child DP.
