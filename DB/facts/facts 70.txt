FACTS

[6]  I propose to state the facts as they must have been found by the jury in returning a verdict of second degree murder.

[7]  Nette knew that Mrs. Loski, a 95-year old widow, lived alone in her own house in Kelowna.  He and a male companion entered the house, tied Mrs. Loskis hands tightly together with wire, tied her feet together with wire, and tied her hands to her feet behind her back.  They wrapped some clothing round her head.  Either the tying occurred when Mrs. Loski was on the bed, or the two men placed her on the bed after she was tied.  They then stole all the money they could find in the house and left.  As time passed, Mrs. Loski must have wriggled about.  She fell off the bed onto the floor.  Some 24 to 48 hours after Mrs. Loski was tied up, she died of asphyxiation.  By that time her dentures had come loose in her mouth and the item of clothing originally placed around her head was fairly tightly wound around her neck.  Of course, Mrs. Loski could not loosen the clothing around her neck or remove her dentures because her feet and hands remained cruelly bound until the end.

[8]  Nette was induced to describe his involvement in Mrs. Loskiï¿½s robbery and in the events leading to her death to an undercover police officer.  His admissions were recorded and put in evidence at his trial.
