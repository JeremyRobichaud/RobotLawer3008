[3]               An accessory after the fact is a person who, “knowing that a person has been a party to the offence, receives, comforts or assists that person for the purpose of enabling that person to escape.” (CC s. 23).  The actus reus of Mr. Corrigan’s offence was assisting Mr. Bown to escape after he murdered Mr. Healey.  Mr. Corrigan has admitted that the specific conduct which assisted Mr. Bown was driving him away from the scene of the murder and to the house, and disposing of the shell casing.  Mr. Corrigan also admits the mental element of the offence:  that he knew Mr. Bown had committed the murder and he, Mr. Corrigan, drove him away from the scene and disposed of the shell casing for the purpose of assisting Mr. Bown to escape.

[4]               I therefore find the admitted facts establish the elements of the offence to which Mr. Corrigan has plead guilty.  I canvassed CC s. 606 with Mr. Corrigan at the hearing of this matter and am satisfied that its requirements are met.  I therefore find Mr. Corrigan guilty of the offence to which he has plead guilty and direct that a conviction be entered.

Mr. Corrigan’s Circumstances

[5]               Both a Pre-Sentence Report and a FAOS Report concerning Mr. Corrigan were prepared and are exhibits on this sentencing. 

[6]               The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that:

-         Mr. Corrigan is 40 years old.  He was 38 at the time of the offence.  He was born in Newfoundland.  As a child he lived with his parents in a small Newfoundland community.

-         His parents’ relationship was dysfunctional.  He was subjected to ongoing verbal and emotional abuse by his father when he was a young child.  His father habitually drank alcohol to excess. His mother was unable to shield him from the abuse. He endured bullying at school because everyone knew of his family abuse. 

-         Mr. Corrigan finished high school and took training in the electrical trade and in heavy equipment operation.

-         In his early 20’s Mr. Corrigan moved to Fort McMurray and has worked and resided there ever since.  He worked as a safety officer, an electrician and a heavy equipment operator in Fort McMurray.

-         He had a long-term relationship with a woman who, like him, was a recovering addict.  They supported each other in their recoveries.  They have an 8-year-old daughter.  He believes his domestic relationship with the child’s mother has ended and his relationship with his daughter has been severely strained by this charge and his incarceration.

-         Mr. Corrigan also has two adult sons but has minimal contact with them.

-         Mr. Corrigan and his father have reached a level of reconciliation in recent years.

-         Mr. Corrigan has a good and healthy relationship with his mother’s husband, his stepfather.

-         Mr. Corrigan’s use of alcohol escalated from modest use when he was a young adult.  At 25 he was a binge drinker.  By age 30 he recognizes that his drinking as a concern.

-         He used illicit drugs experimentally beginning at age 21.  After relocating to Fort McMurray his use of cocaine and ecstasy increased until he was using every day.  He started selling drugs to support his habit.  His family intervened and sent him to Newfoundland in the hopes that his would stop his drug use.  It didn’t.  Rather he progressed to the use of crack cocaine.  He returned to Fort McMurray and lived on the streets.

-         The writer of the Pre Sentence Report indicates that Mr. Corrigan stated that when he was 30 (which was in 2009) he was arrested and remanded in custody on charges on which he was not convicted.  This period in custody appears to have been a turning point for Mr. Corrigan.  He sobered up and after his release from custody he maintained his sobriety.  He attended addictions programs offered by Alberta Health Services and spent time in a residential treatment program.

-         Since then he has had some short relapses.  He attended treatment programs in different Alberta centers.  He has been able to recover from the relapses except for the relapse which occurred about three months before this commission of the offence for which he is now being sentenced.  He used crack cocaine and sold it with Mr. Bown.

-         After his arrest on other matters in July 2018 and his subsequent release, he went to residential treatment program in British Columbia.  After completing that program he returned to Fort McMurray and was arrested on the charge presently before the court.

[7]               The Forensic Assessment and Outpatient Services (FAOS) reports essentially the same information as the Pre-Sentence Report.  In addition, it reports the results of psychological tests which were administered to Mr. Corrigan.  The tests indicated that Mr. Corrigan’s reading ability is significantly limited though it appeared sufficient for the administration of a Personality Assessment Inventory.  However, on that test, Mr. Corrigan’s score on the inconsistency scale exceeded the cut-off for profile validity – he responded inconsistently to a number of items with highly similar content.  The test results were therefore assumed to be invalid and no clinical interpretation was provided.

[8]               On the basis of the information he gathered, Dr. George P. Druska, the author of the FAOS report, concluded that the following DSM-V Diagnosis was appropriate for Mr. Corrigan:

Primary Issue:

Crack Cocaine Use Disorder – Severe

Alcohol Use Disorder – Remission

Dysthymia

Adjustment Disorder – Anxiety

Secondary Issue:

Issues related to legal matters – severe

Issues related to social difficulties – severe

Medical Concerns:

            No Diagnosis.

[9]               Dr. Druska noted that Mr. Corrigan’s substance abuse is long standing, “and in his favour in remission”.  As to “Dysthymia”, which I understand to mean chronic depression, Dr. Druska described it as a “pervasive low intensity depression which is prevalent more days than not.”  The Adjustment Disorder relates to Anxiety symptoms “which are directly correlated with the stressors surrounding the index offence”.

[10]           Dr. Druska also provided a risk assessment.  The testing indicated that Mr. Corrigan is in the “Low range of future recidivism.”

[11]           Dr. Druska concluded his reported as follows:

[Mr. Corrigan] demonstrated and reports insight and understanding in regards to the trigger and motivation for his actions.  It however is my opinion that at times of intoxication, his risk of reoffending would increase significantly.  In Mr. Corrigan’s favor he is aware of the risks of drug use on his mental state and the consequence of a drug induced intoxication state.  Immediately following the Index Offence, he addressed his drug use within a framework of addition treatment.

I would also recommend that Mr. Corrigan participated in an anger management program to develop appropriate and healthy tools to address occurrences of frustration, disappointment, hostility and aggressive thought.  Were he to continue to report symptoms resulting from his legal situation this could be assessed and addressed by the mental team of his custodial institution.

Mr. Corrigan should have conditions that prohibit him from using any alcohol or street drugs upon his release.

In my opinion, Mr. Corrigan’s prognosis is Favourable.  His insight into self, his remorse, and his honesty to discuss the offence and the reasons for his behavior are positive findings towards his future rehabilitation and success.  Further, Mr. Corrigan has engaged in a pattern of thought whereby he accepts that his pattern of drug use is the underlying precipitating factor of his mental health difficulties and criminal behaviour.  Mr. Corrigan’s long term wellness will hinge on his motivation and efforts to address his addiction issues.

Victim Impact Statements

[12]           I was advised that no Victim Impact Statements had been provided in relation to Mr. Corrigan’s offence.

Criminal Record

[13]           The Crown alleged but provided no evidence that Mr. Corrigan has a prior criminal record.  The allegation appears to be based on the Pre-Sentence Report which lists convictions on December 8 and 10, 2008 for “Take a Motor Vehicle Without Consent”, “Possession of Stolen Property over $5,000”, and two counts of Failure to Appear.  The Report indicates that the disposition was a total of 100 days and a $150.00 fine.

[14]           I note that the Report indicates that when Mr. Corrigan was 30 he was arrested but not convicted and spent time in remand custody.  That would be in about 2008.

[15]           The Defence had no information about a prior criminal record prior to receipt of the Pre-Sentence report and declined to acknowledge that one existed.  The Crown was not in a position to prove the record.

[16]           In my view, even if the criminal record referenced in the Pre-Sentence Report exists, it has little significance to the present case.  It is 12 years old and is completely unrelated to the present charge.  I will proceed on the basis that no criminal record has been proved.

Other Charges

[17]           Mr. Corrigan has plead guilty in other proceedings to two other offences, both of them robberies.  One occurred on April 6, 2018 (about two months before the present offence) and the other on July 6 (about three weeks after this offence).  He is to be sentenced on those offences on July 20, 2020.  Counsel advised that none of the time he has spent on remand custody since his arrest on the charge before me relates to those charges – it all relates to this charge.  I was advised that Mr. Corrigan had bail in relation to one of the robbery charges, but I do not know when that was granted.  There was no suggestion that he committed the present offence while on judicial interim release.

Counsels’ Submissions as to Sentence

[18]           Mr. Piper, for the Crown, submitted that a fit sentence in the circumstances is 36 months.  Ms. Bourdon, for Mr. Corrigan, submitted that a fit sentence is 24 months.

[19]           Counsel were also in disagreement as to how the time Mr. Corrigan has been in pre-trial custody should be credited.  To the day of this decision, Mr. Corrigan has been in pretrial custody for 642 days.  The issue is whether the confinement to his cell and transfers back and forth between Edmonton Remand Centre and Calgary Remand Centre since the commencement of the Covid-19 pandemic in mid March, 2020 should result in Mr. Corrigan being given greater than 1.5:1 credit.

[20]           As to the length of a fit sentence, Counsel referred to several authorities:

[21]           In R v Bedi, 2017 BCSC 292, the 21-year-old accused, who had been present at the assault which resulted in the later death of the victim, offended s. 240 by communicating to the murderer that the police were at the murderer’s residence and other information which permitted the murderer to know something of the progress of the police investigation, and by communicating to the murderer that the accused and the murderer should ensure their respective statements as to alibi were consistent and that they should assert control over information provided by a third party with relevant knowledge.  His involvement in the murder had no element of coercion.  He did not cooperate with the police investigation.  The accused had a criminal record and was sentenced after being found guilty at trial.  The offence occurred when the accused was involved in drug use.  By the time of his sentencing he had been successful in ending that involvement.  He was sentenced to 22 months imprisonment.

[22]           In Bedi, Justice Schultes provided an extensive review of the other relevant authorities where sentences covering a broad range were imposed.

[23]           In R v. Matheson, 2015 NSSC 42, the accused plead guilty.  He was asked by the murderer who lived in the next apartment to assist him in disposing of the body of victim.  The 49-year-old accused initially refused to help, but after repeated requests he agreed.  His role was limited to driving the vehicle in which the murderer had put the body.  The accused was coerced to some degree by fear of the murderer.  He cooperated with police.  He was remorseful.  He had a criminal record.  Counsel jointly proposed and the court imposed a sentence of 3½ years.

[24]           In R v. Darby 2016 ABQB 352 the accused was a member of a Calgary street gang.  The 25-year-old accused plead guilty to conspiracy to murder one member of a rival gang and to being an accessory after the fact to the murders of three people: two members of a rival gang and an innocent bystander.  The accused had rented the car that the murderers used in connection with the murders.  The car was returned to him after the murders.  He knew that the car had been used in the murders.  He cleaned it in an effort to remove all trace evidence and returned it to the rental agency.  A positive psychological assessment for the accused was before the Court.  It was aggravating that he was a member of a criminal organization.

[25]           Tilleman J. observed that the accused’s involvement in the murders to which he was an accessory was minimal.  He rented the car which the murders used to travel to and from the scene of the murders.  He cleaned it before returning it to the rental agency.  The vehicle had not been used to transport bodies.  There was no indication that the accused’s actions in cleaning the vehicle assisted the murderers by concealing the offence or allowing them to escape detection.  Tilleman J. referenced British Columbia authority (R v. Steadman 2008 BCSC 1613) in which Barrow J. after reviewing the authorities concluded:  “These cases disclose that a range of sentence for an offender whose involvement is significant and who is not subject to threats of serious harm is between 18 months at the low end and 5 years at the upper end.”  Tilleman J. imposed a sentence of 3 years for the accessory after the fact conviction which was to run consecutively to the sentence of 8 years he imposed for the conspiracy conviction.

[26]           Defence counsel cited R v. Posthumus 2017 ABQB 665 where the accused plead guilty to being an accessary after the fact of manslaughter.  She was sentenced on a joint submission to 90 days in custody, which was time served, and probation.  In my view, this case does not provide much assistance in the determination of a fit sentence for Mr. Corrigan.

[27]           Having considered the authorities cited and the submissions of Counsel, I have concluded that the following factors are of particular significance to the determination of Mr. Corrigan’s sentence:

-         He, like the accused in Matheson and Darby, plead guilty.  This has significant mitigating effect.

-         By his guilty plea Mr. Corrigan has admitted that he drove Mr. Bown from the scene of the murder and disposed of the shell casing for the purpose of enabling Mr. Bown to escape.  He confirmed that he understood and intended his guilty plea to constitute an admission of this essential element of the offence in the s. 606 inquiry.  Whether either of the elements of the assistance actually assisted Mr. Bown to escape was not addressed in either the Agreed Statement of Facts or the submissions of Counsel.  Such information would be relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of Mr. Corrigan’s crime.  If Mr. Corrigan’s acts, though done for the purpose of assisting Mr. Bown to escape detection or arrest did not in fact assist him to do so, the offence would seem to me to be less serious than if they did assist an escape.  I was told nothing of the circumstances of Mr. Bown’s arrest.  I was not told whether Mr. Bown eluded arrest or whether Mr. Corrigan’s assisting actions interfered with the police determination that Mr. Bown was the murderer.  It is not obvious to me that driving Mr. Bown from the scene of the murder to the house (which must have been a drive of less than 10 minutes) and disposing of the shell casing would have constituted significant assistance to Mr. Bown.

-         By contrast to this lack of specificity as to how Mr. Corrigan’s conduct assisted Mr. Bown to escape detection or arrest, the Agreed Statement of Facts is very clear that on two occasions, once in July 2018 when Mr. Corrigan was arrested on another matter (presumably one of the robberies previously mentioned) and once after he returned from treatment for substance abuse, he voluntarily made full statements to police concerning the murder committed by Mr. Bown, cooperated in a re-enactment at the scene of the murder, and showed the police where he had disposed of the shell casing.  Although the extent to which his cooperation with police assisted them in the investigation of the murder is not clear, it seems reasonable to assume it was very helpful.  Indeed, the Agreed Statement of Facts says it constituted critical evidence in the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Bown. In my view, this mitigates the seriousness of Mr. Corrigan’s crime.

-         There was a significant element of coercion of Mr. Corrigan leading to his commission of this crime.  It is an agreed fact that he was concerned about Mr. Bown’s intentions when he learned of them in the course of the drive.  He was concerned that if he refused Mr. Bown’s requests that Mr. Bown would harm him.  Further, when Mr. Bown shot the firearm, he fired past Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Corrigan initially thought Mr. Bown was shooting towards him as well.  He drove Mr. Bown back to the house in this context – the context of actions on Mr. Bown’s part that were reasonably interpreted by Mr. Corrigan to present a continuing danger to himself.

-         No criminal record has been proved. The criminal record alleged but not proved is very dated and unrelated.  The aggravating feature of a relevant criminal record is absent.

-         Mr. Corrigan has recognized that his substance abuse was a fundamental cause of his commission of this offence.  He has taken steps to over come his addictions.  His substance abuse problems are in remission.

-         So long as he remains in remission, Mr. Corrigan, in Dr. Duska’s opinion, presents a low risk of reoffence.

-         Mr. Corrigan is extremely and genuinely remorseful for his involvement in this crime.

-         Mr. Corrigan has training and experience which create a reasonable possibility that he can make a positive contribution to society in future.

[28]           It appears to me that Counsels’ respective submissions (24 months to 36 months) reflect the range within which a fit sentence for Mr. Corrigan lies.  A sentence at either end of that range is reasonably justifiable.  A sentence higher or lower than the range is not.  In these circumstances I conclude that a sentence of 30 months would properly serve the principles of sentencing and reflect the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case.

[29]           As to credit for time in pretrial custody, as noted, Mr. Corrigan has been in custody for 642 days.  For the reasons identified in R v. Summers (2014) 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), 308 CCC (3d) 471 (SCC) I find that Mr. Corrigan is entitled to credit of 1.5 to 1, or 963 days, for his pretrial custody.  By my calculation, 30 months is the equivalent of 912 days (30.4 days per month).  A fit sentence for Mr. Corrigan is therefore a sentence of time served.

[30]           It is not necessary for me to address the question of whether greater credit than 1.5 to 1 should be given for the time Mr. Corrigan has spent in custody during the Corvid-19 pandemic.

[31]           The time Mr. Corrigan has actually served is less than 2 years.  Although I am giving him enhanced credit for that time in custody, his actual sentence is “time served”.  As that is a sentence of less than 2 years, as I read CC s. 731(1)(b), I can also impose a term of probation.  Given Dr. Duska’s recommendations previously quoted, in my view, it is appropriate to do so.  I therefore order that Mr. Corrigan be subject to a probation order for 2 years following his release from custody.  The terms of that order shall be the mandatory terms set out in CC 732.1(2).  For the purposes of the condition required by CC 732.1((2)(a.1) I order that Mr. Corrigan have no contact with Trevor Bown.
