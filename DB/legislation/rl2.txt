III.      The Standard of Appellate Review



[14]                                                           R. v. Shropshire is a leading decision dealing with the standard of appellate review in the sentencing context. The Supreme Court’s analysis begins with an acknowledgment that although s. 687 of the Criminal Code provides that courts of appeal are to consider the “fitness” of the sentence appealed against, the provision is not an invitation for “interventionist” review. At paragraph 46 of its reasons, the Court speaks of an unfit sentence as one “to be clearly unreasonable”. At paragraph 47, the Court refers to case law which requires deference to a trial judge’s imposition of sentence unless there has been a misapplication of principles or, unless, the sentence imposed was “‘clearly excessive or inadequate’”. The Supreme Court goes on to state that “unreasonableness” in the sentencing process involves a sentencing order which falls outside the “acceptable range” of orders.



[15]                                                           While the standard of appellate review with respect to sentencing  decisions has been addressed in subsequent Supreme Court decisions, all of the jurisprudence is canvassed in this Court’s decision in R. v. R.K.J. (1998), 1998 CanLII 12252 (NB CA), 207 NBR (2d) 24 (C.A.), [1998] N.B.J. No. 483 (QL) at paras. 11-13, per Drapeau J.A. (as he then was). See also R. v. Hawkins (R.K.) (2008), 331 N.B.R. (2d) 129, [2008] N.B.J. No. 190 (QL), 2008 NBCA 40 at paras. 7-8, per Richard J.A. writing for the majority and with which the dissenting justice, Bell J.A., is in agreement.



[16]                                                           In brief, this Court has stated that appellate intervention is not justified unless it can be shown that the judge erred in principle or in law. If the sentencing judge applies the wrong principles or test or omits to consider all of the relevant factors or misapprehends the evidence, appellate intervention is warranted. Finally, a sentence is “clearly unreasonable” where it is inordinately long or short and it will only reach this mark if it is a substantial and marked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated offenders committing similar crimes. The latter task is embraced by the parity principle prescribed in s. 718.2(b).



IV.      Parole Ineligibility and R. v. Shropshire



[17]                                                           In R. v. Shropshire, the trial judge had extended the period of parole ineligibility from 10 to 12 years. On appeal, the period was reduced to 10 years on the basis that an extension period was not justified unless “unusual circumstances” were present. The Supreme Court rejected that threshold test and affirmed the trial judge’s decision.



[18]                                                           I pause here to note that prior to Shropshire being decided, this Court had affirmed the adoption of the threshold standard of “unusual circumstances” (see R. v. Black (1990), 1990 CanLII 2583 (NB QB), 110 N.B.R. (2d) 208 (Q.B.), [1990] N.B.J. No 952 (QL), aff’d (1991), 1991 CanLII 12201 (NB CA), 117 N.B.R. (2d) 178 (C.A.), [1991] N.B.J. 821 (QL)). I note also that this standard was recently applied in the Court of Queen’s Bench (see R. v. Beaulieu (G.) (2005), 284 N.B.R. (2d) 356 (Q.B.), [2005] N.B.J. No. 416 (QL), 2005 NBQB 221). On this point, the decision should not be followed. However, this is not to suggest that the trial judge in Beaulieu ultimately erred in fixing the period of parole ineligibility. To the contrary, the decision is otherwise as thorough as it is persuasive.



[19]                                                           In Shropshire, the Supreme Court made two guiding observations that are inevitably cited in any case dealing with parole ineligibility for second degree murder.  The first observation is found at paragraph 27 where the Court states: “…an extension of the period of parole ineligibility would not be “unusual”, although it may well be that in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be awarded.” The second is found at paragraph 31: “…the power to extend the period of parole ineligibility need not be sparingly used.” This statement follows the Court’s rejection of the notion that unusual circumstances must be established before the sentencing judge may go beyond the statutory minimum. The point being that there is “both a range of seriousness and varying degrees of moral culpability” such as to give the trial judge an element of discretion to go beyond the minimum.



[20]                                                           The Supreme Court’s analysis focuses on the three statutory criteria set out in s. 745.4: (1) the character of the offender; (2) the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence; and (3) the recommendation of the jury, if any. While noting that the statutory framework makes no reference to “denunciation” or “assessments of future dangerousness”, the Supreme Court explains that those factors remain relevant considerations. The sentencing objective of denunciation is said to fall within the statutory criterion of the nature of the offence. Similarly, “future dangerousness” was declared a factor to be considered under the rubric of the “character of the offender”. The Supreme Court expressly rejected the notion that the power to extend an offender’s eligibility for parole usurps or impinges upon the function of the parole board. Thus, sentencing judges have the right and obligation to be concerned with the risk of recidivism and whether the offender represents a threat to public safety. However, the Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal had erred in treating those criteria as the only ones pertinent to the task at hand. The Supreme Court went on to hold that deterrence is also a relevant consideration for the same reason. The only difference in terms of punishment between first and second degree murder is the duration of the parole eligibility, thus indicating that parole ineligibility is part of the punishment and, therefore, forms an important element of sentencing policy. As such, the Court held that the sentencing judge must be concerned with deterrence, whether general or specific.



[21]                                                           It is instructive to look at the factual scenario underlying R. v. Shropshire and to see how the Supreme Court applied its analytical framework in support of its conclusion that the Court of Appeal’s intervention in that case was unwarranted. The pertinent facts are plagiarized from the case’s headnote. The 23-year-old accused pled guilty to second degree murder and the Crown had not sought a period of parole ineligibility beyond the minimum. The offence was committed at the accused’s home during a marijuana transaction. Without any warning, the accused shot the deceased three times in the chest as they were about to enter the garage to complete the deal. Two days later, the accused gave himself up to the police. He professed remorse for his actions but was unwilling or unable to explain why he murdered his victim. No motive for the killing was ever ascertained. The accused had a prior criminal record including two convictions in Youth Court for robbery, a conviction for impaired driving, and two narcotic offences as an adult. On these facts the sentencing judgment determined that eligibility for parole should be delayed for 12 years for the following reasons: (a) the circumstances of the killing were strange in that they provided no real answer to why it took place, and the respondent was unwilling or unable to explain his actions; (b) the murder was committed during the course of committing another offence, namely a drug transaction; and (c) the respondent had a record for both narcotic offences and violence. The Supreme Court held that appellate intervention was not warranted.
