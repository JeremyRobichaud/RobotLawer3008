[18]      Tied into each of these issues is the concern about credibility and ultimate reliability of the evidence available to reach appropriate conclusions. The evidence of both D.B. and K.M. requires special scrutiny. Both are witnesses who are "unsavoury", "untrustworthy", "unreliable", or "tainted": R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104; Vetrovec v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811. Accordingly, I will address the evidence from each of D.B. and K.M. as an overarching concern.

[65]      For the same reason Count 5 is proven, but I invite submissions as to whether a stay of either Count 3 or Count 5 is warranted on the basis of R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.
