Background



[3]              In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge described[1] the nature of the offence and the surrounding circumstances as follows:



20.  On December 10, 1997 at approximately 11:30 p.m. the police and emergency medical personal responded to a reported homicide at 11 Carew Street, St. John’s.  Edward Shaw, a resident of that boarding house, had been found dead on the floor of his room, with multiple stab wounds. There were numerous blood stains throughout the room, obviously the result of significant bloodletting from the deceased.



21.  Dr. Simon Avis, Chief Medical Examiner for the province, attended the crime scene and performed the autopsy. He testified that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds which caused massive bleeding.  The likely weapon was a sharp knife approximately 2.5 cm. wide and at least 19 cm. in length.




22.  There were sixty stab wounds and numerous incised wounds.  The wounds were inflicted at various points on the wrists, head, neck and torso of the victim.  The tendons and muscles of both wrists had been cut.  There were wounds to the hands which could have been defensive wounds.  Dr. Avis could not estimate the vigour of any defensive measures but was of the opinion that they were unlikely to have been prolonged. There were stab wounds to Shaw’s face with associated haemorrhaging, indicating that he was alive when these wounds were inflicted.  There were various wounds throughout the neck region including those which cut through the victim’s larynx and severed the oesophagus, left carotid artery in two places and the left jugular vein.  Other wounds penetrated the trachea. In the chest area one grouping of wounds consisted of at least twenty-eight stab wounds to the left lateral chest.  Associated with these were fractures to five ribs which indicated that the stabbing was done with considerable force.  At least twenty-three of these wounds penetrated or perforated the left lung and left ventricle.  Ten stab wounds perforated the right atrium of the heart.  Four wounds perforated the right lung.  There was one litre of blood in the chest cavity. Dr. Avis was of the opinion that the stab wounds in this area with consequential haemorrhaging likely caused death which may have followed within a minute of the infliction of those wounds.



23.  The preceding does not summarize the entirety of Dr. Avis’ testimony and autopsy report though it refers to the key portions thereof and indicates the severity and intensity of the murderous assault upon Shaw.



24.  The crime scene was inspected by Staff Sergeant V. Gorman of the R.C.M.P., accepted as an expert in blood stain pattern analysis.  His report, entered into evidence, concluded:



“1.       Edward Shaw was beaten while on or near the floor in his apartment.



  2.       Edward Shaw lay bleeding on the floor and moved or was moved while on the floor.



  3.       A person with blood on their footwear walked around the apartment.



  4.       The transferred bloodstains and dripping bloodstains could have occurred during the attack, after the attack or a combination of both.”



25.  Testimony from an adjoining resident of hearing sounds from Shaw’s room suggested a time of death of approximately 4:45 a.m. on December 10th, a time within the range estimated by Dr. Avis.  The sounds were not those of a loud argument or violent struggle.  The resident testified that he attributed the sounds to Shaw possibly having another seizure and leaving his room to seek assistance.  That resident further testified that he heard sounds of mopping in the hallway a few hours later. That was consistent with testimony from two police forensic identification officers that the third floor hallway from Shaw’s room to the stairway had been wiped or mopped thereby removing the visible evidence of most bloodstains, including footwear impressions.  The only reasonable inference from the evidence is that Cousins tried to eliminate that evidence of the crime.



26.  Other testimony established that Cousins did not have any noticeable injuries on December 9th and medical evidence confirmed that wounds to Cousins’ hands and legs noticed on December 10th and December 11th were recently inflicted.  Cousins’ efforts to conceal his involvement in the murder included lying to medical personnel about the cause of cuts to his hand when he sought medical treatment on the afternoon of December 10.  More significantly, he concealed from them more serious injuries to his legs which he had bandaged.



27.  Cousins’ own injuries caused bleeding.  On December 11, and subsequently following discovery of the murder, a police investigator found bloodstained clothes deposited in several nearby municipal garbage containers on Military Road and in the Bannerman Park.  The clothes was proven to have belonged to Cousins.  The knife and the footwear worn by Cousins during the murder were not found.  The only reasonable inference is that Cousins disposed of all items which might link him to the crime.



[4]              Cousins was a resident of the boarding house in which  Shaw’s body was found and, like other residents, he was interviewed.  He was first interviewed at 2:33 a.m. on December 11th ; then again at 4:47 a.m.   He was arrested and charged with the murder of  Shaw at 1:22 p.m. on that same day.  At the time of his arrest, a police officer gave  Cousins the standard caution and advised him of his right to counsel pursuant to section 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  When the police officer inquired whether  Cousins wished to speak with a lawyer, the appellant replied that he had already been speaking with a lawyer, whom he named.



[5]              The trial judge held that  Cousins had been advised of his rights twice on December 11th: at the commencement of the first interview and on arrest[2].  There is no suggestion that there was any failure to meet the requirements of the Charter in the information given to the appellant on those two occasions.




[6]              Before his arrest, while at the police station, Cousins was in a room where he could be observed. When a police officer saw that  Cousins was about to make a telephone call, the officer interrupted Cousins to tell him that he could be provided with a private place if he wished to speak with a lawyer.  Cousins was then shown to a room where a private call could be made.  The police officer understood that Cousins wanted to call a lawyer who represented him on another matter, the same person Cousins said, at the time of his arrest, he had already consulted.



[7]              On January 15, 1998, while  Cousins was still in custody, the police obtained a warrant (the DNA warrant),  pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code, to obtain a blood sample.   The DNA warrant required, among other things, that prior to the blood  sample being taken the warrant was to be read to Cousins and that he was to be advised of his right to counsel.   The trial judge found that with one exception the police officer  advising Cousins of his right to counsel gave him the required information, including  that Cousins could call a lawyer before the sample was taken.  However, she did not advise him of the legal aid and duty counsel telephone numbers.  It is this omission which is central to the first ground of appeal. Cousins did not ask to speak with his lawyer, nor did he say that he did not wish to do so before the sample was taken.



[8]              The execution of the warrant was video taped and that tape was played  during the voir dire regarding the admissibility of the DNA evidence.  The trial judge also heard the evidence of the police officers who were present, as well as that of the Doctor who took the blood  sample.  The appellant did not give evidence on the voir dire.  The Crown concedes that the evidence obtained as a result of the execution of the warrant was an important part of the case against Cousins.



First Ground of Appeal



[9]              The appellant maintains that the blood samples were obtained in violation of certain Charter rights and that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence derived from the samples.  The relevant sections of the Charter are:



8.   Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.



10.  Everyone has the right on arrest or detention



...



(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right;



... .



The appellant argues that the failure of the police officer to include the telephone numbers when advising him of his right to counsel on January 15, 1998 is fatal: that evidence obtained as a result of the sample taken cannot be admitted and the trial judge erred in doing so.  The arguments in respect of both sections of the Charter depend on the alleged failure to comply with section 10(b) of the Charter. The submission of the appellant respecting section 8 of the Charter is that if the appellant is correct in respect of the submission regarding section 10(b), thereby making the seizure contrary to law, the seizure becomes unreasonable.  It must be remembered that the DNA warrant required that the right to counsel be given to the appellant.   However, the argument before the Trial Division and this Court was based on an allegation of a breach of a Charter right, not the failure to comply with a “condition” of the warrant.



[10]         The trial judge ruled that in the execution of the warrant in the Penitentiary there had been a separate detention, one which triggered again the requirement to advise the appellant of his rights.  The Crown has not challenged that ruling and I, therefore, make no comment in respect of this finding.



[11]         The purpose of the right to counsel contained in section 10(b) of the Charter is “to provide detainees with an opportunity to be informed of their rights and obligations under the law and, most importantly, to obtain advice on how to exercise those rights and fulfil those obligations” ( R. v. Bartle, 1994 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173 at p. 191).  The information which must be conveyed when advising a person of his right to counsel includes information about access to counsel free of charge provided by provincial Legal Aid where an accused meets financial criteria with respect to need, and information about access to duty counsel, who provide immediate and temporary legal advice to all accused, irrespective of financial need ( R. v. Brydges, 1990 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190) .   Bartle clarified this right by adding that the person detained should be informed of the means necessary to access these legal services. Generally, this requires that telephone numbers be provided to the detainee, including 1-800 numbers for duty counsel, where they exist.  However, in Bartle, Lamer C.J. said at page 204:




Conversely, situations may occasionally arise in which the authorities’ duty to make a reasonable effort to inform the detainee of his or her s. 10(b) rights will be satisfied even if certain elements of the standard caution are omitted.  In my view, however, this will only be the case if the detainee explicitly waives his or her right to receive the standard caution (for example, by interrupting the police when they begin to read the caution and telling them that they do not have to continue) and if the circumstances reveal a reasonable basis for believing that the detainee in fact knows and has adverted to his rights and is aware of the means by which these rights can be exercised.

(Emphasis in original)



Counsel for the appellant argued this case on the basis that the trial judge erred in finding that Cousins had waived his section 10(b) rights.



[12]         The trial judge did not find that Cousins had waived his right to counsel.   Rather, he  observed that Bartle recognized that there were rare occasions when section 10(b) rights will be satisfied though certain elements of the standard expression of the rights are missing and, further, he held that this was one such case.  In this context, there is no point in reviewing the trial judge’s decision on the basis of waiver.  Rather, the question is whether the trial judge was correct in his conclusion on the evidence before him.



[13]         It is true that the requirements of section 10(b) of the Charter are relatively strict but the appellant takes a too narrow and formulaic view of the requirements.   Indeed, Chief Justice Lamer himself made this clear in R. v. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217. On arrest, and later before an interview, Mr. Latimer was advised of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, of the availability of Legal Aid duty counsel and of his right to remain silent. He was not given the toll-free number for legal aid, nor was he given the telephone number of the local legal aid office.  The Court held that in the circumstances there had been no violation of Mr. Latimer’s section 10(b) rights.  As to the toll-free number, it was not in operation at the time of day of the arrest and therefore failure to provide it could have had no effect.  At paragraph 37, Lamer C.J., for the Court, said of the failure to provide the local number:




I also have no doubt that the information that was provided to Mr. Latimer adequately apprised him of the means to contact the duty counsel service which was available at the local Legal Aid Office. Mr. Latimer was informed of that duty counsel service on two occasions - when he was arrested at his farm, and before the commencement of his interview at the police station.  Admittedly, on neither occasion did the arresting officers verbally give Mr. Latimer the phone number for the local Legal Aid Office.  However, s. 10(b) did not require the arresting officers to take that extra step, under the circumstances of this case. Where an individual is detained during regular business hours, and when legal assistance is available through a local telephone number which can easily be found by the person in question, neither the letter nor the spirit of Bartle is breached simply by not providing that individual with the local phone number. Mr. Latimer was perfectly capable of obtaining the number.  He could have consulted a telephone book either at his farm, or at the police station if he had asked for one.  Moreover, at either location, he could have obtained the number from Directory Assistance.  There is nothing to suggest that had he asked the police for it, they would not have provided it.  Finally, at the police station, there was a telephone sitting in front of Mr. Latimer, with a telephone number on it for Legal Aid.  I also note that at both locations, Mr. Latimer was asked if he understood or had any questions about what he had been told.  He replied in the negative on both occasions.



[14]         So then , whether the police have met the burden in a particular case must always be determined with regard to all the circumstances of that case (Latimer, paragraph 34). Here, the following circumstances  must be considered.



1.       From the time of his first appearance in Provincial Court in connection with this matter[3] to trial, the appellant was represented by the same counsel[4], not the person he called on December 11th  and not the counsel who represented him before this Court.  In fact, during submissions to the trial judge, Cousins’ counsel made a point of the fact that the police were aware that he represented Cousins but at no point did they advise him they were going to execute the DNA warrant.  (There is, of course, no requirement at law that counsel for the person from whom a bodily substance is to be collected be informed prior to the taking of the sample. See paragraph 56 of R. v. S.A.B., 2003 SCC 60, which stated the ex parte nature of the proceedings to obtain a DNA warrant to be “constitutionally acceptable.”)



2.       As noted above, in the context of this matter, by January 15th Cousins had already been given the standard right to counsel on at least two occasions,  and he had, on his own initiative, contacted counsel, thereby demonstrating that he was capable of exercising his rights.




3.       The DNA warrant was executed shortly after 3 p.m. on a Thursday, that is, during regular business hours.



4.       The trial judge found that “Mr. Cousins appeared to understand the warrant and the nature of the procedure and the proceeding that was underway.  ... he nodded at suitable occasions.  He mouthed  yes although it was not audible on one occasion and he, he audibly indicated an understanding of the process and of Constable Chaulk’s statements when she asked him.”  Later in his decision the trial judge added: “I would comment that the - with respect to the warrant, it was read clearly to him.  Mr. Cousins indicated he understood.  His other comments that day, principally to Dr. Avis, indicate and (sic) understanding and awareness of the events that were unfolding.  There was nothing in the evidence, principally from the video, to indicate or call into question ... his capacity to understand or that called him to question the fact that he did understand what was happening on that day .”



5.       The provisions of the Criminal Code respecting DNA warrants (ss. 487. 04 to 487.09) themselves do not violate the requirements of a reasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the Charter ( R. v. S.A.B. and R. v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607). The validity of the DNA warrant itself is not in dispute.



[15]         The trial judge was correct when he concluded that there had been no breach of Cousins’ right to counsel.  The purpose of the right was met by the information provided on January 15th.  Cousins chose not to assert the right on that occasion.  The absence of the telephone numbers, in this context, does not result in a Charter breach.



[16]         The trial judge held, in the alternative, that if there had been a breach of the section 10(b) rights, the evidence should not, in the circumstances of this case, be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. In light of the conclusion that the trial judge was correct when he held that there was no breach of the section 10(b) rights, there is no necessity to consider this point.



The Second Ground of Appeal



[17]         The second issue is whether this Court should interfere with the period of ineligibility for parole imposed by the trial judge pursuant to section 745.4 of the Criminal Code,  the operative parts of which state:



Subject to section 745.5, at the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender ... having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.2, by order, substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than twenty-five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.



Section 745.5, which deals with offenders under the age of 16, has no application to this case.



Standard of Review



[18]         The Supreme Court of Canada has enunciated the standard to be applied by appellate courts in the review of sentences imposed by trial judges. Absent any error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit (R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 and R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948). This principle applies equally to questions concerning the period of parole ineligibility (see: Shropshire).



Positions of the Parties



[19]         Simply put, the position of the appellant is that a period of twenty five years ineligibility for parole should be reserved for the rarest of cases and this case does not fall within this category. In other words, the appellant argues that the sentence, as it relates to parole ineligibility, is demonstrably unfit. In support of this position he refers to a number of other cases, which are said to be comparable, where the period of ineligibility for parole was set at  between 14 to 20 years.  The Crown takes the position that the trial judge considered the appropriate factors and no error in principle having been demonstrated, this Court cannot interfere with the decision of the trial judge.




Character of the Offender



[20]         At the time of sentencing Cousins was 51 years of age.  With one exception his criminal record relates to offences committed in the 1970s.  In 1993 he had a conviction for possession of a narcotic, for which he received a fine of $200.  There is surprisingly little other evidence which would provide insight into Mr. Cousins’ character.  There is, however, another crime which is highly relevant to the question of his character.



 -      The Squires Murder



[21]         Cousins has also been convicted of another  murder (the Squires murder).  In fact, Squires was killed before  Shaw but Cousins was not convicted of that offence until after the Shaw murder[5]. The relevant dates for the purpose of this case are:



Squires murdered                                                   28 March 1994

Shaw murdered                                                      10 December 1997

Cousins convicted of Squires murder                      3 March 1999

Cousins sentenced for Squires murder            29 March 1999

Cousins convicted of Shaw murder                         30 June 2000

Cousins sentenced for Shaw murder                         6 July 2000



The trial judge dealt with these facts in this way:



... Subsequent to the murder of Shaw Cousins was convicted ... of the second degree murder of Marvin Squires ... .  Though this is not a prior conviction it is relevant when assessing Cousins’ character and must be considered with all other factors when making a determination under Section 745.4.



The appellant agrees that the trial judge’s stated approach to the Squires conviction is correct.  That is, the conviction for the murder of Squires can be considered as a factor in the examination of the character of Cousins.



[22]         It should be noted that the trial judge expressly referred to section 745(b) of the Criminal Code which provides that a person convicted of second degree murder shall not be eligible for parole for 25 years if that person had previously been convicted of murder.  However, he also noted that the Crown accepted the position reflected in R. v. Harris (1993), 1993 CanLII 4275 (QC CA), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 284 (Que. C.A.) that section 745(b) only applied to a case where the second murder was committed after the conviction for the first, which is not the case here. (See also: R. v. Okkuatsiak (1994), 1994 CanLII 10360 (NL SC), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (N.L.T.D.).) Section 745(b) played no part in the choice of the period of 25 years ineligibility for parole.  The interpretation of section 745(b) not having been raised in this appeal, I make no comment on this point.  The question here is whether this Court should interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion to impose  25 years ineligibility for parole.



Nature of the Offence & Circumstances Surrounding the Commission of the Offence



[23]         The trial judge’s description of the nature of the offence and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence is reproduced at the beginning of this decision (see paragraph 3).   Shaw, who was then 60 years of age, was the victim of a brutal attack.  There was nothing before the trial judge which would explain why Cousins killed Shaw. The trial judge stated that he did not draw an adverse inference from Cousins’ silence on that subject.  However, it should be noted that what evidence there was indicated that the victim was a slightly built man.  He had no alcohol in his system when he died and the only evidence of drugs was that there was an appropriate amount of a drug prescribed for Shaw to help prevent seizures, to which he was prone.  He was a long term resident of the boarding house, lived on a different floor than Cousins and generally kept to himself.  Other residents indicated that there had been little contact between Shaw and Cousins during the three months Cousins resided in the home.



Recommendation of the Jury



[24]         At paragraph 28 of his decision, the trial judge said of this factor:




         The jury recommended that the period of parole ineligibility be set at twenty-five years. The jury heard no evidence respecting Cousins’ background and did not have the opportunity to compare the circumstances of this case with others cited herein.  Though I am not bound by the jury’s recommendation it is an influential factor as these members of the community heard lengthy evidence respecting commission of the offence and Cousins’ efforts to evade detection.



The trial judge’s statement of the role of the recommendation of the jury is correct.
