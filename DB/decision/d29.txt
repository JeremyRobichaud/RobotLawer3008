Having concluded the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ellsworth did not actually commit an offence contrary to s. 267(1)(b), and having further concluded the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ellsworth aided or abetted Chaisson in the commission of an offence contrary to s. 267(1)(b), I find Ellsworth not guilty.

In summary, the accused John Troy Chaisson is guilty as charged, and the accused Rodney Joseph Ellsworth is not guilty.
