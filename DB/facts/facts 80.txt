LINDA BOWEN and Andrew Kay stand charged:

1. That they, on or about the 26th day of January, 1987, near Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, Alberta, did unlawfully kill Special Constable Gordon KOWALCZYK, a police officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police acting in the course of his duties, and did thereby commit first degree murder, contrary to the Criminal Code.

[2]                           After 4 1/2 weeks of trial, during the second last day on which evidence was presented the accused Linda Bowen, with the consent of the Crown, entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter, and the court accepted that plea and entered a conviction for manslaughter. She will be sentenced following the delivery of these reasons for judgment which relate solely to the accused Andrew Kay.

[3]                           The accused persons are mother and son. In late 1986 and until their arrest on 23rd February 1987, they lived in a small house in the countryside near Crossfield, Alberta, which is north of Calgary. Until late January 1987, another resident of the house was Iris Nunns, who worked as a waitress at a restaurant, as did the accused, Bowen. In the latter part of December 1986, and until the arrests, a fourth resident of the house was a younger son of the accused Bowen, Michael Kay.

[4]                           In the narration of these general circumstances, it must be remembered that I rely only upon the testimony of Iris Nunns and Michael Kay, for the statements made by Bowen to the police during the day following her arrest, while admitted in evidence, were evidence which can be used only in regard to the prosecution of Bowen and cannot be used in regard to the prosecution of Andrew Kay. This is because as far as the case against him is concerned, the evidence of what his mother told the police about the history of the matter is not admissible because of the rule excluding evidence of hearsay.

[5]                           In deciding whether the accused Andrew Kay is guilty or not guilty of the offence with which he is charged, I have cast from my mind the statements made by Bowen to the police. As against Kay, the only serious issue is one of identity, i.e., was it Kay who killed the deceased? The Crown’s case against him is based upon circumstantial evidence.

[6]                           The deceased, Special Constable Gordon Kowalczyk, was a special constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“R.C.M.P.”). There is no doubt on the evidence, and no issue was made of it, that at the time of being killed he was “a police officer … acting in the course of his duties” within the meaning of s. 214(4) of the Criminal Code. That provision is quoted later in this judgment. Nor is there any doubt that, whoever killed him, that person did so intentionally, that is, he meant to cause his death therefore the culpable homicide was murder pursuant to s. 212(a)(i) of the Code. It is clear from the medical and other evidence that whoever killed him did so after Constable Kowalczyk had fired all the rounds in his revolver at the driver’s door of the truck driven by the killer, and that one of the wounds suffered by Constable Kowalczyk was fired at him by a shotgun, the barrel-end of which was less than two feet from his face. That shot was undoubtedly fired when Constable Kowalczyk was lying on the roadway, defenceless and already badly wounded by five other wounds caused by the discharge of a shotgun at him.

[7]                           On Sunday, 25th January 1987, Special Constable Kowalczyk was on duty as a member of the unit of the R.C.M.P. charged with the responsibility of patrolling the Calgary International Airport, which is in the north-east part of Calgary. That unit’s responsibilities for law enforcement covered the airport property and certain lands contiguous or near to it, including a Budget Self-Service Gas Bar at the south end of the area of the unit’s responsibilities. At about 11:50 p.m., one of Constable Kowalczyk’s colleagues, Special Constable Marshinew, received a telephone call at the R.C.M.P. office in the airport terminal. The call was from Robert Schmidt, the attendant at the gas bar, who told Constable Marshinew that a man in a small maroon four wheel drive Toyota pickup truck had just driven away from the gas bar without paying for the gasoline he had put into the truck. Constable Kowalczyk was already in a marked R.C.M.P. patrol car, travelling southward on Barlow Trail, away from the airport. Constable Marshinew passed the complaint to Constable Kowalczyk by radio. Constable Kowalczyk replied, stating his location, which was by a tank farm. He said that he had just seen a small truck pass him, northbound on nearby Air Services Way and was turning around to go after it. Constable Marshinew left the terminal building in another patrol car to back Constable Kowalczyk up. He approached an intersection east of the terminal building and saw Constable Kowalczyk’s car and spoke to him. Constable Kowalczyk said that he was going to follow a vehicle that was northbound on Highway 2A, which leads northward from the north-east side of the airport area. After waiting for a change of traffic lights, Constable Marshinew drove northward on Highway 2A but never again came within sight of Constable Kowalczyk’s car before Constable Kowalczyk was killed.

[8]                           Constable Kowalczyk reported by radio that he was at 112 Avenue behind a vehicle that was not the one of which the complaint had been made because it was a blue Ford, but that he intended to follow it as it was going at a good clip. As Constable Marshinew assumed that the Ford was not driven by the thief, he turned around. A short time later, Constable Marshinew heard Constable Kowalczyk saying on the radio that he was going to be stopping a blue Ford truck, and he gave a licence number and location. Shortly thereafter Constable Marshinew heard Special Constable Hazelwood, who was supervisor of the shift at the R.C.M.P. office in the airport terminal building, inform Constable Kowalczyk by radio that the check of the licence plate number given by means of the Canadian police intelligence computer, was negative, meaning that the vehicle to which that licence number was assigned was not recorded as having been stolen.

[9]                           Shortly after midnight, three men who were employees of an airline at the airport left their work and, in a vehicle owned by one of them, drove northward on Highway 2A toward Airdrie, where they resided. They came upon an R.C.M.P. patrol car, stopped with its lights flashing in the middle of the road. Upon reaching it, they saw the police officer’s body lying on the roadway, about five or six feet in front of the police car. They stopped and one of them used the patrol car’s radio to call for help. Moments later, at 12:17 a.m. on 26th January Constable Marshinew, who in the meantime had turned around and headed north in search of Constable Kowalczyk, came upon the scene. There was no other vehicle at the scene than Constable Kowalczyk’s car and that of the airline employees.

[10]                       Constable Kowalczyk was dead. His revolver was missing. Three spent shotgun shells lay on the roadway. His flashlight, which was on, lay at his feet.

[11]                       Other policemen arrived on the scene about ten minutes later, in particular Constable Goodridge who arrived at 12:27 a.m. He found the three spent shotgun shells, and one live round of ammunition of the type used by the R.C.M.P. for a revolver of the type Constable Kowalczyk had. He found particles of glass which one may theorize came from another vehicle, although there is no evidence that it matched the broken glass found in the driver’s door in the truck later found. He found a baseball cap lying on the roadway. It was black and had a Quaker State emblem.

[12]                       At about 7:15 a.m., the attention of Max Calisa, maintenance supervisor at the Sunridge Shopping Mall in north-east Calgary, was drawn to a truck parked in the parking lot of the mall. It was still dark and the inside dome light was on. He found that the passenger door was ajar, and closed it. About 7:30, he checked the truck again on the driver’s side and noticed that the licence plates did not match, the driver’s window was down, and there were bullet holes in the driver’s door. He reported the matter to the security authorities in the mall, who in turn called the police. This was, as the evidence establishes, the vehicle which was being operated by the killer or by someone with the killer when Constable Kowalczyk was killed. It was a black four wheel drive pickup truck with the word “Ford” on its back. Later that morning, in the area in which the truck had earlier been found and from which it had by then been towed away by the R.C.M.P., a customer of the Sunridge Mall, Ronald Hewitt, found a shotgun shell in the parking lot.

[13]                       The next major development in the chronology occurred at about 3:10 a.m. on 22nd February 1987 when a woman entered a Boston Pizza restaurant in Edmonton, about 300 km north of Calgary, and robbed the restaurant of the cash in the till. She showed the sole employee on duty what appeared to be a revolver in her purse. After she left the restaurant she was pursued by customers but as she ran across the nearby street, a man standing by a car, toward which she was running, shouted at the lead pursuer, Bruce Shemko, to get back and discharged a shotgun once into the air. Mr. Shemko withdrew and the car left with the man and woman in it. Mr. Shemko noted the car’s licence number, GSL 431. This proved to belong to a car owned by the accused Linda Bowen. Although this is not in evidence, one may assume that this led to the arrest of the accused and of Michael Kay on the night of 23rd February shortly before midnight, at their residence. The man who discharged the shotgun in Edmonton left the cartridge shell behind in the snow, and as the evidence has shown, that shell was fired from the shotgun seized at the home of the accused at the time of their arrests.
