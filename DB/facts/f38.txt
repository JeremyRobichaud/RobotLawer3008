[2]        These are the facts grounding the charge. 

[3]        On January 16, 2013, Kevin Maurice and Brian Lee were working at an off-sale establishment in Fort Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan.  At approximately 8:05 p.m., the appellant and Jesse Ray entered the store.  They selected a bottle of Wiser’s whiskey and some cigarettes and attempted to pay for them at the counter with a debit card.  After several unsuccessful attempts to get the debit card to work, the appellant grabbed the bottle of whiskey and ran out the door, closely followed by Mr. Ray.  Brian Lee followed the men out the door and chased after them.

[4]        After about 100 metres of pursuit, the appellant turned around, pulled a knife from his pocket and confronted Mr. Lee.  The appellant swung the knife at Mr. Lee from a distance of about 1.5 metres.  Mr. Lee testified he believed this was just a warning as the appellant was not close enough to strike him with the knife.  The appellant then verbally threatened Mr. Lee.  Mr. Lee recalled the threat when he testified, “And then he told me even if you still are chasing me I will hurt you, so I answer to him, okay, you go.”  The police were then called by Mr. Maurice.

[5]        Three officers immediately attended the scene.  Within a short time, the police found the appellant and the co-accused running from the scene and arrested them after a brief struggle.  A bottle of whiskey and a knife were found near the appellant when he was arrested.  At trial, Mr. Lee identified the knife as being the one used by the appellant to threaten him.  

[6]        Shortly after being arrested, the appellant provided the police with a warned statement where he admitted, among other things, that he had:  i) stolen the bottle of whiskey; ii) run out of the store with the whiskey; iii) had a knife when he threatened Mr. Lee; and, iv) dropped the knife when the police caught him.
