With regard to the last point raised, I would reject the argument of the respondent by applying the same principles as those found to apply by this court in the recent decision of R. v. Ouellette (A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 18768 (NB CA), 182 N.B.R.(2d) 306; 463 A.P.R. 306; 111 C.C.C.(3d) 336. Once the respondent has availed himself of the services of counsel, he cannot contend that his right to be informed. of the right to counsel, pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter, has been breached so as to exclude the certificate obtained after the breathalyzer test has been performed. Similarly, I do not accept that he can argue that his right to retain counsel of his choice has been breached where he chose to consult alternative counsel, because he was unable to reach counsel of his choice after having made a number of attempts. Mr. Clarke gave a breath sample voluntarily, after speaking to counsel which he called himself; there was no violation of his Charter rights under s.

10(b). [8] With regard to the first issue, I would affirm the decision of this court in Diotte and reverse the decision of the Queen's Bench Justice. In Diotte, Chief Justice Strat-ton clearly stated that the mental element involved in these cases is voluntary intoxication. The care and control offence lies not in the intention to drive the vehicle, but in voluntarily becoming intoxicated and in taking some actions by which the offender is involved with the vehicle in a way which may cause danger to the public. This position is founded on the principles enunciated in R. v. Ford, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 231; 40 N.R. 451; 1982 CanLII 16 (SCC), 36 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 254; 101 A.P.R. 254; 65 C.C.C.(2d) 392, at p. 399 [C.C.C.] and R. v. Toews, 1985 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119; 61 N.R. 349; 21 C.C.C.(3d) 24. [9] There is no necessity of proving that the offender was posing an immediate danger to the public in order to find him guilty. It is the possibility that the vehicle may be put in motion, intentionally or unintentionally, by a person who is intoxicated, that poses a problem of public safety (see R. v. Parker, [1992] N.B.J. No. 134 (Prov. Ct.); R. v. Rose (1987), 3 M.V.R (2d) 1 (Ont. Dist. Ct.); R. v. Sinclair, [1990] B.C.J. No. 2744 (C.A.); R. v. Green (1989), 1989 ABCA 290 (CanLII), 100 A.R. 131; 52 C.C.C.(3d) 93 (C.A.); R. c. Loubier, [1994] A.Q. No. 343 (C.A.); R. v. Vall√©e (PA.) (1993), 1993 ABCA 301 (CanLII), 145 A.R. 274; 55 W.A.C. 274 (C.A.); R. v. Ganpatt (D.), 1995 CanLII 18030 (AB QB), [1995] A.J. No. 1139; 177 A.R. 311 (Q.B.); R. v. Guyot, [1993] B.C.J. No. 1011 (S.C.)).
