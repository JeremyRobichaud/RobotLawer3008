I will begin examining the gravity of the central offence â€“ the assault offence - by recounting the act that Mr. Guitard has been found guilty of. The assault on Mr. Hodge occurred after Mr. Guitard boarded a bus while extremely intoxicated. He was mumbling. With some difficulty Mr. Hodge was able to understand that Mr. Guitard did not have money to pay the fare. Mr. Hodge did him the kindness of nonetheless permitting Mr. Guitard to ride. After a short time Mr. Guitard approached Mr. Hodge and asked to get off at Bronson St. Mr. Hodge told Mr Guitard that they had already passed Bronson St. Mr. Guitard became upset and told Mr. Hodge to drive back, and shoved him causing the bus to swerve into oncoming traffic. Mr. Hodge told Mr. Guitard not to touch him. Mr. Guitard began swearing at Mr. Hodge, calling him crazy. He then punched Mr. Hodge in the shoulder. The punch was not painful, but Mr. Hodge took it as a real threat and decided to pull the bus over.  The brakes were hit hard enough to disrupt the passengers as Mr. Hodge activated the emergency lights and brought the bus to a stop. Mr. Guitard got out of the bus when he learned the police were coming. While he was waiting for them he challenged Mr. Hodge to a fight.
