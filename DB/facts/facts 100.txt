[1]               On April 3rd, 2005, Nina Courtepatte was kidnapped, transported to the Edmonton Springs Golf Course, sexually assaulted and murdered. As a result, five persons were charged with first degree murder, aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping, including the accused in this trial, S.R.B.

 

[2]               I will commence with a summary of the facts, indicating which are not disputed, and what are the crucial areas of factual dispute in this trial.

 

[3]               It is clear that the five persons charged were present during some or all of the events. The persons are Joseph Laboucan, who was convicted of first degree murder, aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping; Michael Briscoe, who was acquitted on all charges; M.W., who has pled guilty to first degree murder; D.T., whose trial commences in May of this year; and S.R.B.

 

[4]               The Crown contends that the murder was planned and deliberate as defined in s. 231(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 (the “Code”), the plan having been formulated by Mr. Laboucan. Mr. Laboucan was convicted of a planned and deliberate first degree murder, and the defence in this case takes no issue with the allegation that Mr. Laboucan had a plan; however, a significant issue for this trial is what, if anything, S.R.B. knew about it. I will review in detail the evidence on this point.

 

[5]               The Crown contends that the murder was committed during the commission of other offences, including aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping, so that it was first degree murder committed in the context of a domination offence under s. 231(5) of the Code. Again, Mr. Laboucan was convicted of first degree murder under s. 231(5), and the defence in this case takes no issue that this was a murder in the context of a domination offence, but there are issues as to whether the S.R.B. participated in a domination offence, or can be convicted of first degree murder on this basis. Again, I will review the evidence on point.

 

[6]               Nina Courtepatte and her friend, K.B., were at West Edmonton Mall, where they met Mr. Laboucan and S.R.B. The two girls were taken from the mall to the golf course in a car driven by Mr. Briscoe. Mr. Laboucan, M.W., D.T. and S.R.B. were also in the car. The evidence clearly establishes this, and the defence does not dispute it.

 

[7]               Miss Courtepatte and K.B. were lured to the golf course by Mr. Laboucan under the false pretense that they would be going to a party. The evidence supports this, and the defence does not dispute, again, that Mr. Laboucan did this, but does dispute S.R.B.’s knowledge and participation. The evidence on this point will be reviewed.

 


[8]               At the golf course, everyone except Mr. Briscoe walked together from the road where the car was parked, down a gravel path and onto a “grassy area”, a fairway. Mr. Briscoe followed them a short time later. Before Mr. Briscoe arrived there was talk of rituals and killings, and soon afterwards S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte. Four eyewitnesses saw the hit or its immediate aftermath, and Mr. Briscoe heard sounds consistent with a hit. The defence concedes that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte. However, there are inconsistencies in the evidence regarding the hit which must be considered, particularly whether S.R.B. pushed or hit Miss Courtepatte with her hand or fist, or hit her with a wrench.

 

[9]               Miss Courtepatte was then held down on the ground and sexually assaulted, first by Mr. Laboucan and then by M.W. Mr. Laboucan was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and M.W. gave evidence and admitted that he sexually assaulted Miss Courtepatte. The Crown alleges that S.R.B. held onto Miss Courtepatte’s hands or arms during a sexual assault. The defence disputes this. I will review the evidence on point.

 

[10]            Before the completion of the sexual assaults, S.R.B. and K.B. left the fairway and returned to the car. This is supported by all of the evidence with the exception of the testimony of Mr. Laboucan. I find, with the support of both the Crown and the defence, that Mr. Laboucan’s testimony on this point should not be accepted and that the Crown’s evidence establishes that S.R.B. was not present after the sexual assaults when Miss Courtepatte died. The evidence relating to how she and K.B. came to leave the area is significant and will be reviewed in detail.

 

[11]            After S.R.B. and K.B. left, Miss Courtepatte was choked with a wrench and beaten to death by blows to the head with a hammer or mallet. The blows were inflicted by Mr. Laboucan and M.W. Mr. Laboucan also tried to slit Miss Courtepatte’s throat with a throwing knife, but the knife was not sharp enough to cut her skin. Mr. Laboucan instructed D.T. to stab Miss Courtepatte with the same knife, and she did so. Mr. Laboucan has been convicted of murder as a result his actions, and M.W. pled guilty and also admitted in his testimony in this trial that he hit Miss Courtepatte two or three times in the head with a mallet or sledgehammer. D.T. gave evidence in this trial and admitted that she stabbed Miss Courtepatte. The evidence of the forensic pathologist, Dr. Dowling, was that Miss Courtepatte died as a result of blunt cranial trauma.
