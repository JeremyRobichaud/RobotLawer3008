Conclusion

 

[33]            There is no evidence of planning and deliberation or that the Applicant committed the alleged murder while committing the offence of criminal harassment. Therefore, the preliminary inquiry judge had no jurisdiction to order the Applicant to stand trial for first degree murder. As conceded by the parties and found by the preliminary inquiry judge, there is no issue regarding the sufficiency of evidence to commit for second degree murder. The appropriate remedy is therefore to amend the committal from first degree to second degree murder.
