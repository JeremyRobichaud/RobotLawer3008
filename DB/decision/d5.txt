E.      CONCLUSION
[46]           For all the reasons set out above, the constitutional attack on s. 745.51 is dismissed and Millard and Smich are both sentenced to life imprisonment with a 25 year period of parole ineligibility, to run consecutively to the 25 year period of parole ineligibility imposed by A. Goodman J. on June 17, 2016 in relation to the Bosma murder. In other words, the total period of parole ineligibility is 50 years.

[47]           I would like to thank all counsel for their very effective advocacy and for their assistance to the Court throughout this long and difficult case.
