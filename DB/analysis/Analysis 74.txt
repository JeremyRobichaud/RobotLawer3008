Positions of the Parties

[86]                     The parties agree that both moral involuntariness and overbreadth are principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter.  The parties also agree that section 17 of the Code infringes an accused’s section 7 right to liberty by taking away the defence of duress for the offence of murder.  The disagreement of the parties is whether that deprivation of an accused’s right to liberty is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

[87]                     The accused makes three arguments in favour of his submission that the statutory exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence of murder for a principal (as opposed to a party) violates the principle of moral involuntariness, or is overbroad, contrary to section 7 of the Charter.

[88]                     To begin, he says the issue was in essence decided by the hypothetical LeBel J gave at para 44 of Ruzic (set out in para 114 of this decision).  The Crown submits this perspective is an overly simplistic view of Ruzic.

[89]                     Next, the accused argues that the trial judge erred in his analysis by considering irrelevant factors such as proportionality, the uncertainty of a threat versus the certainty of the death of an innocent person and communal interests in determining the constitutionality of section 17 of the Code.  He says the trial judge made a false assumption that an innocent third party’s life is “inherently more valuable than any right of an accused.”

[90]                     The accused relies on various legal and philosophical authorities from around the globe that argue that the fundamental issue in the case of duress is the injustice of convicting a person for a crime, even murder, when they succumb, understandably, to a given external danger.

[91]                     The Crown says that it is well accepted that the principles of fundamental justice relate to a broad spectrum of interests beyond those of an accused.  Accordingly, it submits that the trial judge did not err in examining questions relating to proportionality and the sanctity of life.

[92]                     The Crown argues that because of the value our society places on the sanctity of human life, the trial judge was correct to conclude it can never be proportionate to excuse murder on the basis of the certainty resulting from the taking of human life versus the mere possibility of death or bodily harm based on a threat.  The Crown also says the calculus of weighing the comparative value of life is an entirely repugnant concept under the criminal law.  According to the Crown, all life must be treated equally under the law, and it is constitutional for Parliament to prevent a jury from ever having to decide if the offence of murder should be excused by the defence of duress in the case of a principal or co-principal.  The Crown also says an accused always has a realistic choice other than to commit murder in the form of acting in self-defence.  Finally, the Crown agrees with the trial judge that the views of the Court of Appeal in Aravena should not be followed to decide this appeal.  To support its position, the Crown also relies on various authorities from multiple jurisdictions.

[93]                     The third submission of the accused is that Parliament should have enacted a less restrictive law that would allow for the defence of duress to be assessed on a case-by-case basis by a jury rather that have a list of offences, such as murder, excluded from the defence automatically.  He says that statutory exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence of murder is overbroad.  For that submission he relies on what he says is the modern trend in favour of having no offences for which the defence of duress is restricted, as is the case in civilian countries or countries that have a civilian-common law tradition like South Africa (see S v Goliath (1972), 3 S Afr LR 1(A) (translation at 465)), common law jurisdictions that have followed the Model Penal Code approach and international criminal law.

[94]                     The Crown replies by saying that the accused is essentially making a policy argument for law reform, not a constitutional submission as to Parliament’s power to restrict the defence of duress.  It also says there is no such trend as the accused suggests; to the contrary, it says there is no consensus as to what the law of duress ought to be.  In its view, the challenged law is not overbroad because it does not lead to the possibility of liability for morally involuntary conduct.

Analysis and Decision

Standard of Review

[95]                     The standard of review of the trial judge’s decision on the constitutionality of the aspect of section 17 of the Code that is challenged is one of correctness.

Purpose of the Challenged Law

[96]                     The trial judge accepted the Crown’s submission that the accused’s overbreadth analysis was nothing more than “a mere recapitulation” of his argument on moral involuntariness which added nothing to an evaluation of the challenged law under the Charter (at para 20).  Accordingly, it was not necessary for him to identify the purpose of the challenged law for his section 7 analysis.

[97]                     The trial judge did however, in his section 1 analysis, summarize his view of the objectives of the exclusion of the defence of duress from the offence of murder as being “[t]he expression of society’s disapprobation for murder—the most heinous crime known to law; [and] [t]he maintenance of the strictest disincentive to cooperate with criminal threats, which in the context of s. 17 operates to preserve life, public order and security” (at para 81).

[98]                     The sentiments expressed by the trial judge have been said many times before and carry great force, however, I think it best for the disposition of the accused’s section 7 arguments to separate the precise purpose of the challenged law from its effects and the social values behind it (see Carter v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5 at paras 76-78, [2015] 1 SCR 331; and R v Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55 at paras 27-32, [2015] 3 SCR 485).

[99]                     At the centre of any criminal defence is a normative evaluation of the standard of conduct the law expects (see Benjamin L Berger, “Emotions and the Veil of Voluntarism:  The Loss of Judgment in Canadian Criminal Defences” (2006) 51 McGill LJ 99 at 110 (citing R v Morgentaler, 1988 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1988] 1 SCR 30 at 70); see also Ruzic at para 25).  What then is the ultimate aim behind Parliament’s law removing the defence of duress from the offence of murder?

[100]                 There was no explicit statement of legislative purpose for the challenged law in 1892 that is of assistance to this Court.  The text, content and scheme of the legislation and the extrinsic evidence does, however, evidence that in 1892 Parliament endorsed the view in the Report that Hale’s “stern rule” (as they called it) should be codified as it was the “existing law” and they believed it was good public policy to continue it (at p 43).  Hale’s rule (at least as far as a principal as opposed to a party) has been accepted in numerous decisions across the common law world to be, as Lord Simon stated in Lynch, “the consensus of the centuries” (at p 695).

[101]                 But what exactly is the consensus that Parliament endorsed?  It is something distinct from the Biblical commandment thou shalt not kill, as that conduct is captured by the offence of murder.  Hale was a lawyer and jurist, not a theologian.  He also certainly wasn’t a pacifist.  Intentionally killing another was not necessarily an offence in his view, so long as it was done in self-defence.

[102]                 The difficult questions Lord Coleridge asks in Dudley and Stephens in the context of necessity about the impossibility of balancing life against a life are of assistance (see p 287).  His concerns would have been well known to Parliament in 1892; they are essentially timeless questions about the relationship between law and morality.  Lord Coleridge’s comments were endorsed by Lord Hailsham in Howe (see pp 430-31) as being also applicable to the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder.  Lord Hailsham goes on to say that if one is allowed to balance a life against life, the law is embracing the “morally disreputable principle that the end justifies the means” (at p 433).

[103]                 Lord Coleridge gives another insight in Dudley and Stephens which is of further assistance.  As he explains, when the temptation to murder arose after ordinary men had been adrift for almost three weeks on the high seas, it was “the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting” that was “chosen” to die (at p 287).  Does that fact surprise anyone?  It has been all too common in the course of human history that, in a time of peril, it is the most vulnerable amongst us that require the protection of the law the most.  As the American jurist Benjamin Cardozo poignantly remarked (Benjamin Cardozo, “Law and Literature” in Margaret E Hall, ed, Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo:  The Choice of Tycho Brahe (New York:  Fallon Publications, 1947) 339), “There is no rule of human jettison” (at p 390).

[104]                 Lord Ward explained the purpose of the law this way in Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins:  Surgical Separation), “The policy of the law is to prevent A being judge in his own cause of the value of his life over B’s life or his loved one C’s life, and then being executioner as well” (at p 1014) (see also Howe at p 456).

[105]                 The balancing of a life against a life in the context of self-defence, however, is a different story, both for Hale and in the Code.  The law distinguishes necessity and duress from self-defence because in the latter, the victim is “the author of his or her own deserts, a factor which arguably warrants special consideration in the law” (Hibbert at para 50).

[106]                 The common thread that one can glean, albeit from a record that is far from perfect, as to the purpose of the challenged law is the concern about anyone having the right to balance life against life, except in a case of self-defence, when the decision will affect their interests.  In this sense, the rule’s aim is to prevent one descending into the moral quicksand of trying to determine whose life is more important (or less important) in a given context, when they have an inherent bias as to who should live and who should die.  In my view, that is the normative evaluation of conduct that Parliament chose to legislate in 1892, and it is the purpose of the statutory ban of the defence of duress from the offence of murder.  The trial judge in his discussion of proportionality was correct in stating that, “Parliament has chosen to legislate such that it is not open for anyone to decide who should live or die” (at para 45).  For the purposes of Charter analysis of the challenged law, this legislative objective is assumed to be appropriate and lawful (see Moriarity at para 30).

Is the Defence of Duress Inconsistent with the Offence of Murder?

[107]                 In Ruzic, the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated its position in R v Penno, 1990 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1990] 2 SCR 865; and R v Finta, 1994 CanLII 129 (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 701, that the mere fact that a defence is restricted or removed all together by Parliament from a particular offence does not lead automatically to a violation of section 7 of the Charter.

[108]                 In terms of Charter analysis of a law restricting a defence, the Supreme Court of Canada in Ruzic cited with approval the earlier comments of Cory J in Finta that, “when a defence is inconsistent with the offence proscribed, in that it would excuse the very evil which the offence seeks to prohibit or punish” (at p 865) it will generally not violate section 7 of the Charter for Parliament to restrict or remove the defence (see Ruzic at para 23).

[109]                 In Ruzic, the Court distinguished Finta and Penno because the duress facing the accused, in terms of the threat of future harm to her mother by the tyrant in that case, a man called Mirkovic, was not inconsistent with illegal conduct associated with drug smuggling (see para 24).

[110]                 What about excusing the commission of murder due to the threat of death?  There is a persuasive argument that it would be inconsistent for the reasons stated by Cory J in Finta to excuse the commission of murder on the basis of duress because the harm caused is the exact same harm that the offence of murder prohibits, the taking of human life.  However, I would not decide this appeal on this basis.  Rather, this reality is a good barometer that the statutory prohibition against the defence of duress being raised on the offence of murder does not violate the principle of moral involuntariness, nor is it overbroad.

Challenge to the Law on the Basis of Moral Involuntariness

[111]                 Two questions arise from Perka, Ruzic and Ryan that are necessary to decide in determining whether a law that restricts or removes a defence from a particular offence violates the principle of moral involuntariness.

[112]                 The first question is does the restriction or removal of the defence deprive a person of “any realistic choice” whether to break the law (Ruzic at para 47; see also Perka at p 251; Ruzic at paras 29, 40, 47; and Ryan at para 40)?  If the challenged law ensures that, “there is a reasonable legal alternative to disobeying the law, then the decision to disobey becomes a voluntary one” (Perka at p 252).

[113]                 The second question focusses on the proportionality between the harm done and the benefit accrued.  Even when a person lacks a realistic choice other than to disobey the law, the harm caused by their illegal conduct cannot be greater than the harm sought to be avoided measured on the standard of what is expected of a reasonable person similarly situated (Perka at p 253; and Ryan at paras 53-54).

[114]                 I would begin by looking at how the challenged law impacts the realistic choices available to those faced with the “kill or be killed” scenario that the accused argues was his predicament in this case.  I see no merit in the accused’s initial argument that the constitutionality of section 17 of the Code in relation to the defence of duress and the offence of murder was decided by the Supreme Court of Canada simply because of the hypothetical LeBel J used in Ruzic (at para 44):

 

Consider next the situation of someone who gives the accused a knife and orders her to stab the victim or else be killed herself.  Unlike the first scenario, moral voluntariness is not a matter of physical dimension.  The accused here retains conscious control over her bodily movements.  Yet, like the first actor, her will is overborne, this time by the threats of another.  Her conduct is not, in a realistic way, freely chosen.

[115]                 LeBel J is explicit in Ruzic that, the “appeal does not concern the constitutional validity of the list of excluded offences” in section 17 of the Code such as murder (at para 19).  Also the context of the hypothetical is the difference between physical and moral involuntariness and their unifying premise, the importance of individual autonomy and choice (see paras 44-45).  Moreover, LeBel and Cromwell JJ make it clear in their reasons in Ryan that the Supreme Court of Canada has not yet had the opportunity to consider the constitutionality of any of the exclusions from the defence of duress in section 17 (see Ryan at para 84).  I expect if the question was decided in Ruzic, the Court would have said so in Ryan.

[116]                 That said, the hypothetical mentioned in para 44 of Ruzic is a good one on the question of the scope of realistic choices afforded by the challenged law because the hypothetical is reasonably foreseeable.  The deficiency with it, in terms of whether the challenged law takes away any realistic choice, is that the hypothetical is not a case where the threatened party lacks a realistic choice other than to stab the innocent person to death with the knife.

[117]                 Leaving aside the question of simply trying to negotiate your way out of the dilemma, attempting escape (there are not enough facts to the hypothetical to say whether those options are feasible), or refusing to submit to the threat (the option of sacrifice), the actor who is given the knife by the tyrant has another reasonable legal alternative in the form of self-defence; he can turn on the aggressor and resist him even to the point of using deadly force.  As the California Supreme Court commented in Anderson, “As a practical matter, death will rarely, if ever, inevitably result from a choice not to kill.  The law should require people to choose to resist rather than kill an innocent person” (at p 373).  This view is the same as Hale—that an actor will have the option of deadly force in self-defence if faced with the kill or be killed scenario.  Resisting a threat may be a hard choice, but so is the decision to kill an innocent person.  Moral involuntariness is a high threshold, as compliance with the law has to be “demonstrably impossible” (Perka at p 251).

[118]                 What about where self-defence and more obvious lawful alternatives, like negotiation and flight, can be ruled out as realistic choices to avoid a threat?  Laskin JA discussed such a reasonably foreseeable scenario in the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in Ruzic (see R v Ruzic (M) (1998), 1998 CanLII 5265 (ON CA), 112 OAC 201).  It took the form of what he called the “typical hostage case” (at para 51).  The hypothetical would go something like this.  A hostage would be under the control of a tyrant at an unknown location and the threatened party would be instructed through some medium to murder another person or else the hostage would be brutally tortured or killed.  Self-defence, negotiation and escape are not realistic options because the threatened party doesn’t know where the hostage and the tyrant are located and he or she lacks the technological capacity to find them.  According to Hale, this would leave only one option—refusing to submit to the threat, thereby risking the life of the hostage.

[119]                 In fairness to Hale, when he was thinking about duress, it was a time of primitive law enforcement and limited ability to communicate in a timely way.  There is now another feasible option.  That option is seeking rescue by law enforcement.  One of the first legal thinkers to advance the alternative of rescue specifically to the taking of innocent life was Cardozo.

[120]                 In writing about the decision of Dudley and Stephens, Cardozo agreed with Lord Coleridge’s concern about the impossibility of allowing for the choice of who shall live and who shall die.  But he challenged the idea of balancing a life against a life not strictly on moral grounds, but also from the perspective of rescue.  For Cardozo, the choice to balance life against life is an unreasonable one also because of the uncertainty that such choice ever has to be made.  He commented, “Who shall know when masts and sails of rescue may emerge out of the fog?” (at p 390).  To Cardozo, there is no such thing as a certainty that the choice to balance life against life need be made at all.

[121]                 In the hostage scenario, it is difficult to see why it would ever be demonstrably impossible for our threatened party to not turn to the police, as opposed to resorting to the murder of an innocent party.  The police would have the capacity to locate the site where the hostage was located by conducting a police investigation.  The police will have resources, and possibly knowledge about the hostage taker, beyond that of the ordinary person.  Also, if the police are not contacted, the threatened party would be relying on the faulty assumption that the amoral tyrant, who is prepared to compel the death of an innocent person, would also piously keep his or her promise and release the hostage from danger if the murder was committed.

[122]                 One could argue that perhaps the police cannot be trusted because the threat has or will take place in a jurisdiction outside Canada where the police are corrupt or not diligent as was the suggestion in Ruzic (e.g., see R v Ajami, 2010 ONCJ 284 (CanLII)).  This sort of reasoning, however, unreasonably stretches the boundaries of what is reasonably foreseeable.  LeBel J made it clear in Ruzic that such “unverifiable assertions” open the defence of duress up to abuse (at para 87).  A reasonable person would reject out of hand that Canadian authorities would not make their best efforts to prevent a murder by reaching out to a responsible international partner in a foreign location.  Ajami of course involved only a property crime in Canada to save a relative threatened in Lebanon, not murder, so the acquittal in that case based on the common law of duress is understandable.  However, based on Nur, it would be going too far afield to say that a Canadian law might be unconstitutional because of the remote situation that foreign police might not investigate a serious hostage case involving death or bodily harm to a resident of their jurisdiction and, that Canadian authorities also might be unwilling or unable to do anything that may thwart the threat.  Such a speculative assertion is not reasonable (see R v Tan Phuong LE (No 3), [2010] NSWDC 37 at paras 30-43 (AustLII)).

[123]                 In his reasons, the trial judge was very alive to the problem of the uncertainty that a threat will ever be carried out, versus the certainty that follows from the commission of murder.  Professor Jerome Hall makes the same point as the trial judge that the threat of harm from a human source is never inevitable given such possibilities as self-defence or rescue (Jerome Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law, 2nd ed (Clark, New Jersey:  Lawbook Exchange, 2010) at 447-48).  To begin, he points out that there is always the off chance that the “evil-doer,” as he puts it (at p 447), might change his or her mind on carrying out the threat.  There is logic to this idea because, unlike a peril emanating from nature like a tidal wave or blizzard, it is reasonably foreseeable that even a tyrant may retreat from his or her threat based on a reassessment of his or her best interests.  Hall also then argues, as I have discussed, that there is always a way to conceivably avoid a threat without taking an innocent life.

[124]                 What about the situation of a hard case that lies near the borderline of a person acting in a morally involuntary way?  This scenario is dealt with by several of the judges in Howe (at pp 433, 445-46, 457) who suggest that the criminal justice system has safeguards in the form of prosecutorial discretion and/or the royal prerogative of mercy (sections 748 and 749 of the Code) for a hard case.  Lord Hailsham in Howe states that the loss of a defence in some cases is not “an excessive price to pay” in order to ensure the sanctity of human life in light of these safeguards in the system (at p 433).

[125]                 In my respectful view, these obiter comments in Howe should not be followed in construing and defining the parameters of moral involuntariness.  The idea that prosecutorial or executive discretion will remedy the potential of liability for morally involuntary conduct is simply one that cannot be accepted for the purposes of section 7 of the Charter.  Before a pardon is granted, a person must be criminally responsible (see Lynch at p 707 per Lord Edmund-Davies).  I do accept that such remedies are available to safeguard the overall public interest (see R v Latimer, 2001 SCC 1 at paras 89-90, [2001] 1 SCR 3, on the question of the royal prerogative; and Eimear Spain, The Role of Emotions in Criminal Law Defences:  Duress, Necessity and Lesser Evils (Cambridge, UK:  Cambridge University Press, 2011) at 130, on judicious use of prosecutorial discretion in cases of necessity and duress), but that is a separate question from whether an individual should be stigmatized and punished for their conduct.  In my view, debate about hard cases always turns on whether obedience with the law is demonstrably impossible and, if so, was the harm inflicted proportional as explained in Perka, Ruzic and Ryan.  I take the view that the effect of Parliament’s policy choice in section 17 of the Code in relation to the offence of murder is that there is always a way out of a threat from another.  As Hall and Cardozo argue, it is not reasonably foreseeable that options such as negotiation, flight, acting in self-defence or seeking rescue from law enforcement will be unfeasible options for a person facing an external danger from a human source.

[126]                 Hall also tackles a related point on Hale’s other option, sacrifice.  Hall says that the law cannot accept as “dogma” that humans will always choose to live if they must kill an innocent undeserving person (Hall at p 446).  The point is a controversial one.  How a person may react under extreme emotions such as fear, guilt, love of another and the relevance of that to the principle of moral involuntariness is a complicated problem.  It was not a point argued before the trial judge or this Court, and accordingly, all I would say is that the law cannot assume people will act mechanistically under extreme pressure based on some vague concept of general human instinct; human psychology is more complex (see Berger at pp 108-10; Alexander Reilly, “The Heart of the Matter:  Emotion in Criminal Defences” (1997-98) 29:1 Ottawa L Rev 117 at 122 and 147-49; and Spain at pp 66-122).

[127]                 The more typical criticism of Hale’s notion of not submitting to a threat and potentially sacrificing yourself rather than killing an innocent party is that, as the accused argues, it would not be the reaction of the ordinary person, so the law should not expect an unrealistic standard of conduct.  Rumpff JA in Goliath states (at p 480):

 

In the application of our criminal law, in the cases where the acts of an accused are judged by objective standards, the principle applies that one can never demand more from an accused than that which is reasonable, and reasonable in this context means, that which can be expected of the ordinary, average person in the particular circumstances.  It is generally accepted, also by the ethicists, that for the ordinary person in general his life is more valuable than that of another.  Only they who possess the quality of heroism will intentionally offer their lives for another.  Should the criminal law then state that compulsion could never be a defence to a charge of murder, it would demand that a person who killed under duress, whatever the circumstances, would have to comply with a higher standard than that demanded of the average person.  I do not think that such an exception to the general rule which applies in the criminal law, is justified.

 

[128]                 One shortcoming of the decision in Goliath, in my respectful view, is that the Court does not address the question of whether the accused in that case had alternatives other than to submit to the order of the other accused to hold down the victim, while the other accused stabbed him.  It strikes me that it is too quick to excuse such conduct when a person in such circumstances has the options of intervening to stop the murder, or simply fleeing to contact the police (which by itself may have saved the innocent party’s life).  Moral involuntariness is concerned with the injustice of people having to make an unfair choice, not simply of making an agonizing one.  Leaving aside my concern that Goliath sets the bar too low for moral involuntariness, it should not surprise anyone that Rumpff JA’s comments (echoed by Lord Morris in Lynch at p 670) about what should be expected of ordinary people in difficult circumstances have drawn strong disagreement.

[129]                 Lord Hailsham, following the same view as Hall, commented in Howe that it should not be assumed that ordinary people will necessarily be tempted to murder under extreme circumstances.  He argues that just because some people will resort to murder and some will not, does not mean that the law should excuse those who murder.  He says that the law should not cast “the cloak of its protection upon the coward and the poltroon in the name of a ‘concession to human frailty’” (at p 432).

[130]                 Of course Howe and Goliath are distinguishable in one important sense.  Both are cases where the courts did not have a statute that lays down the expected standard of conduct of the ordinary person.  In those two cases, the courts were tasked to draw the line in the absence of legislative direction.  Here the focus is narrower, as Parliament has made the policy choice as to what the relationship is between the defence of duress and the offence of murder.  The only issue is the constitutionality of that policy choice.

[131]                 While the debate between eminent jurists and scholars over whether a person should be expected to sacrifice him or herself, rather than to submit to a threat and murder an innocent person, is intellectually interesting, it has little ultimate relevance to constitutional review of Parliament’s law.  There are several other realistic choices available for the ordinary person in such perilous times, such as negotiation, flight, acting in self-defence or seeking rescue by turning to law enforcement.  A law is only constitutionally suspect because of the principle of moral involuntariness when it gives a person “no legal way out” to avoid an external danger other than to disobey the law (Perka at p 252).

[132]                 In summary, the accused has not advanced any persuasive authority or reasonably foreseeable hypothetical that raises a concern that Parliament’s decision to remove the defence of duress from the offence of murder would make it inevitable that a person facing a sufficiently grave threat from another would have no realistic choice but to succumb to the threat and murder an innocent third party.

[133]                 I wish to turn now to the question of proportionality, even though I am satisfied that it is not inevitable that the challenged law would ever force a person to balance life against life due to an external human danger.

[134]                 I reject the accused’s argument that the trial judge erred by considering the question of proportionality in evaluating the constitutionality of the statutory exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence of murder.  Proportionality is an inherent component of moral involuntariness (see Ryan at para 70).  In Perka, Dickson J explained (at p 252):

 

No rational criminal justice system, no matter how humane or liberal, could excuse the infliction of a greater harm to allow the actor to avert a lesser evil.  In such circumstances we expect the individual to bear the harm and refrain from acting illegally.  If he cannot control himself we will not excuse him.

 

[135]                 The trial judge did not, in my view, also err by balancing “competing social interests or public benefits” conferred by the challenged law in his section 7 analysis instead of in a section 1 analysis (Carter at para 79).  As Fletcher explains proportionality is the device that is resorted to make a “moral judgment” about what society expects of people in trying situations (Fletcher at p 804).

[136]                 In several decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada has concluded that a broad spectrum of interests have to be considered in construing the content and scope of the principles of fundamental justice (see Cunningham v Canada, 1993 CanLII 139 (SCC), [1993] 2 SCR 143 at 151-52; R v Seaboyer; R v Gayme, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 SCR 577 at 603; Rodriguez v British Columbia (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 519 at 592-93; R v Malmo-Levine; R v Caine, 2003 SCC 74 at paras 96-99, [2003] 3 SCR 571; and R v Demers, 2004 SCC 46 at paras 44-45, [2004] 2 SCR 489).

[137]                 In my view, the statements in Carter are not a departure from that long line of authority.  Indeed, in Ruzic, the Court made it abundantly clear at para 58 of its decision that the interests of third parties and the state, together with those of the threatened party, form part of the analysis in defining the defence of duress.  Proportionality, as Fletcher has articulated it for defining the parameters of the principle of moral involuntariness, is a more limited concept than the proportionality inquiry envisaged by R v Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 SCR 103, when considering whether a law that infringes the Charter can nevertheless be justified under section 1 of the Charter.

[138]                 The trial judge came to the conclusion that murdering an innocent person can never satisfy the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness.  In Aravena, in consideration of the common law defence of duress in relation to a party charged with murder, the Ontario Court of Appeal came to an opposite conclusion (see para 73).  Are these two views reconcilable?

[139]                 I would begin by noting four concerns that, in my respectful view, need to be taken into account in addressing the decision in Aravena.

[140]                 First, of course, it is quite clear given the Howe decision that the approach in England rejects, as the trial judge here concluded, that murdering an innocent person can ever be excused based on a claim of duress.  In Aravena, the Court suggests that the English authorities are based on a “deterrence-based policy argument” (at para 76) and the view that duress is a justification, not an excuse (see para 81).  I cannot respectfully agree with either of these suggestions.

[141]                 The history of the exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence in murder in England has always been based philosophically on a deontological basis, not a utilitarian deterrence-based model contrary to what Aravena suggests.  As previously noted, Hale and Blackstone were moralists, not utilitarians, in how they thought about the standard of expected conduct the law requires to ensure the sanctity of human life.  The same can be said about the remarks of Lord Coleridge in Dudley and Stephens.  Professor Rupert Cross explains a “good utilitarian” would have difficulty in deciding whether to approve or disapprove of an outcome when the evil done and the evil threatened are equal, as is the case in the kill or be killed scenario (Rupert Cross, “Murder Under Duress” (1978) 28 UTLJ 369 at 374).

[142]                 Lord Brooke commented in A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) that, while the criminal law has shifted away from the tenets of moral philosophy as society has become more secular and multi-cultural, “there is no evidence that this process is at work in that part of our law concerned with the protection of human life between the moment of birth and the moment of death” (at p 1025).  Lord Hailsham argues in Howe that the respect and concern shown for innocent human life in the “bad old days of Blackstone and Hale” is not an obsolete, inhumane or unjust idea (at p 433).

[143]                 Lord Hailsham’s concern in Howe that recognizing the defence of duress to the offence of murder as being adoption of the philosophy that, “the end justifies the means” is another deontological perspective, different than the absolutist moral position of Hale (at p 433).  Lord Hailsham’s comment borrows from Immanuel Kant’s famous second categorical imperative that human life is an end in itself, not a means to an end.  According to Kant and his followers, it is unethical that a person should be used as a means to an end by another (see Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, ed and translated by Mary Gregor (Cambridge, UK:  Cambridge University Press, 1997) at 37-41).  In that spirit no one has the right to use another human life as a way to attempt to escape a threat of another.

[144]                 Leaving aside the deontological philosophy that has always underpinned the challenged law, the sanctity of life principle is not simply a product of moral principles; it is one of the few generally accepted cultural norms by people of all beliefs and backgrounds.  The Supreme Court of Canada noted in Rodriquez that the idea that human life is inviolable is a “generally held and deeply rooted belief” in society (at p 585); and further in Carter, “The sanctity of life is one of our most fundamental societal values” (at para 63).  The sanctity of life principle is based on concern for the intrinsic value of life and also respect for the dignity of every human being.

[145]                 In my view, it is a misunderstanding of history to rationalize the bar to the defence of duress from the offence of murder on a utilitarian basis.  There is another reason why in Lynch and Abbott, the judges at times revert to utilitarian arguments about deterrence in analyzing the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder.  It has to do with the jurisprudential question of when it is appropriate for appellate judges to change an existing common law rule.

[146]                 In Lynch, the Court by a majority of four to one (the exception being Lord Edmund-Davies (see p 713)) accepted that the common law based on Hale was that a principal cannot raise the defence of duress to the offence of murder.  That rule had nothing to do with any utilitarian logic; it was based on Hale’s fusion of morality and the law.  In their dissents on the question of a different rule for a party charged with murder, Lord Simon (see p 696) and Lord Kilbrandon (see p 702) refer to the idea of deterrence, in the context of modern events (the threat of terrorism and organized crime), as a good reason not to change the common law and depart from the historical rule that duress can never be a defence to anyone charged with murder.

[147]                 In Abbott, Lord Salmon (see pp 766-67) for the majority invokes the utilitarian logic of deterrence in light of modern events (the threat of terrorism and organized crime) as reason not to develop the common law to allow for duress to be a defence to a principal charged with the offence of murder.  In his dissent, Lord Wilberforce argued that Hale’s understanding of duress requires a “fresh eye” in light of other policy arguments he raises (at p 771).  All of this discussion about the utilitarian theory of deterrence amongst the judges is about what the law ought to be, not what it is, which is of course the deontological perspective of Hale.

[148]                 I return now to Howe.  Not once in the entire decision do any of the judges refer to the utilitarian idea of deterrence in deciding to overrule Lynch, contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeal in Aravena.  In the leading decisions of Lord Hailsham, Lord Griffiths and Lord Mackay, all three judges come to the conclusion that Lynch needs to be overruled, not to deter murder, but to restore the law to its traditional understanding as expressed by Hale.  Lord Hailsham (at p 434) and Lord Griffiths (at p 444) refer to the modern threats of terrorism and organized crime as even more reason to do so for moral reasons, not utilitarian ones.  The judges in Howe are returning the law to its traditional deontological foundation that protection of the sanctity of life requires a bright-line rule for the defence of duress as exists for the defence of necessity based on Dudley and Stephens.  Many may disagree with the idea of judges fusing law and morality, but there should be no mistake that is exactly what occurred in Howe.  The English judges’ perspective is that the law imposes a duty on everyone not to take innocent life based on an external danger.

[149]                 My second concern is with respect to the comment in Aravena that English law sees the defence of duress as a justification, not an excuse.  That, in my respectful view, has never been the view of England’s highest Court, except for some awkward language at times used by individual judges (see Baker, Textbook of Criminal Law at 867; and Stanley MH Yeo, Compulsion in the Criminal Law (Sydney:  Law Book Company, 1990) at 35-41).  Most recently in Hasan, Lord Bingham, citing Lynch and the Supreme Court of Canada in Hibbert, stated that the defence of duress does not negate an ingredient of an offence nor does it justify the conduct, rather, “Duress is now properly to be regarded as a defence which, if established, excuses what would otherwise be criminal conduct” (at para 18).

[150]                 In Ruzic, LeBel J commented (at para 68) that, “The English common law formulation of the defence of duress now appears generally similar to its Canadian counterpart” (at para 68).  Indeed, if one compares side-by-side para 81 of Ryan and paras 21(2)-(7) of Hasan, the two jurisdictions take a strikingly similar approach.  The noticeable difference is the unresolved question of whether Paquette still continues to be the common law in Canada that duress is a defence to the offence of murder for a party (see Ryan at para 83).

[151]                 The third concern I have about Aravena is the uncertainty it may cast on the defence of necessity.  The Supreme Court of Canada has always attempted to keep the defences of duress and necessity as consistent as possible on a juristic basis.  Historically, Fletcher’s understanding of proportionality has been relied on to define both defences as excuses (see Perka at pp 250-52; Hibbert at para 54; Ruzic at paras 29-31).  In Latimer, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that it was “difficult, at the conceptual level, to imagine a circumstance in which the proportionality requirement [of necessity] could be met for a homicide” (at para 40).  That said, the Court left open the question of whether proportionality could ever be met in a homicide situation.  In doing so, the Court pointed out that the authorities, including Howe and Dudley and Stephens, are against the idea that a homicide can ever be a proportional act.

[152]                 Unlike the case of duress, there is no statute defining the law of necessity in Canada; it is a function of the common law as explained in Perka and Latimer.  What is the law in Canada regarding the defence of necessity and the offence of murder after Aravena?  According to Dudley and Stephens, the defence of necessity is denied to any participant in a murder.  That view of the law has never been departed from by an appellate court in Canada.

[153]                 The uncertainty that Aravena creates, in my view, was predicted by Lord Simon (see p 692) and Lord Kilbrandon (see p 701) in Lynch, if one attempted to have different juristic approaches to the defences of duress and necessity in the case of the offence of murder.  To me a reasoned argument can be made on the basis of Aravena that Dudley and Stephens is no longer the law, at least in Ontario, with respect to the defence of necessity and the offence of murder.  The concerns of Lord Simon and Lord Kilbrandon as to what follows from opening the door to allowing the defence of duress to the offence of murder were strongly approved of in Howe (see pp 429, 453) by Lord Hailsham and Lord Mackay.

[154]                 My fourth and final concern with Aravena is that throughout the discussion of the proportionality in the decision there is, with respect, an undue emphasis on the unfairness of a threatened individual being expected to sacrifice themselves rather than commit murder.  While that has always been the most controversial part of Hale’s understanding of duress, it is not, as I have explained, particularly significant to whether the principle of moral involuntariness is infringed by section 17 of the Code.

[155]                 Despite the detailed and thoughtful reasons of the Court of Appeal in Aravena, I decline to follow its approach, both to the question of proportionality in terms of moral involuntariness, as well as its obiter comment that the statutory exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence of murder in section 17 of the Code infringes section 7 of the Charter, absent justification under section 1 of the Charter.  It is my respectful view that Aravena does not provide assistance to this Court in deciding the correctness of the trial judge’s conclusion that murdering an innocent person can never satisfy the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness.

[156]                 Any discussion of proportionality and what is expected of a reasonable person similarly situated to the individual facing an external danger in the context of murder must begin with the fact that the offence of murder raises unique and controversial concerns about proportionality distinct from the other excluded offences listed in section 17.  As Lord Keith stated in Gotts, “Murder is a crime in a category of its own” (at p 418).  This is because it involves the intentional and irreparable destruction of human life and also because a conviction for it carries with it the highest stigma and punishment afforded by the criminal law (see R v Martineau, 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1990] 2 SCR 633 at 645).

[157]                 The trial judge in his reasons essentially accepted the perspective of Cardozo and Hall that it is always too uncertain to ever commit murder in the face of a mere threat of another.  This was also the same perspective of the trial judge in Aravena (see para 91 of Sandham).

[158]                 It is difficult to see how a certain death is a proportionate response to an uncertain threat from another.  I would add another feature of uncertainty to the discussion different than Cardozo and Hall, that arises on the facts of this case.  Here, the murder of Ms Tran did not extricate the accused and his family from danger.  The drug debt was not forgiven.  Even by committing murder, the accused was still in the same position he was in before the murder.  As previously mentioned, it is unrealistic to evaluate the law of duress on the assumption that the amoral tyrant, prepared to compel murder, is also an individual who will piously keep their word once the innocent person is murdered.

[159]                 The discussion of proportionality in the decision of the appeals chamber for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 7 October 1997 Prosecutor v Erdemović, IT-96-22-A is of assistance.  The question in that case was whether a soldier could advance duress to excuse being punished for participating in a firing squad of innocent civilians because he was told by other soldiers that if he did not participate, he too would be shot.

[160]                 The majority of the Court in Erdemović rejected the idea that duress can ever be a defence to the murder of innocent civilians under international humanitarian law.  In his dissent, the well-known Italian jurist and scholar Antonio Cassese rejected an absolute bar to the defence of duress absent a consideration of proportionality.  On that question, he said (at para 42):

 

[I]t will never be satisfied where the accused is saving his own life at the expense of his victim, since there are enormous, perhaps insurmountable, philosophical, moral and legal difficulties in putting one life in the balance against that of others in this way:  how can a judge satisfy himself that the death of one person is a lesser evil tha[n] the death of another?

 

                                          [emphasis in original]

 

[161]                 Cassese goes on to make an exception on the basis of the idea of a mors ineluctabilis (inescapable/inevitable death) (see para 42).  Now in the midst of an armed conflict, what is reasonably foreseeable in terms of duress is quite different than the situation inside a stable democracy like Canada.  Indeed, Hale himself drew a distinction regarding the nature of the defence of duress “between the times of war, or public insurrection, or rebellion, and times of peace” (Hale at p 49).

[162]                 Cassese’s perspective as a civilian-trained jurist on the question of proportionality is of more relevance that trading a life for a life fails the standard of proportionality.  While the accused argues, as the decision in Erdemović explains, that many civil law countries do not create explicit bars in their statutory law to the defence of duress being raised to any offence, including murder, the logic of Cassese casts a degree of clarity that the law may not be all that different between the majority of common law jurisdictions and many civil law countries that the defence of duress can never excuse the offence of murder.  In their decision in Erdemović, McDonald and Vohrah JJ note that the proportionality requirement between the harm caused by the actor and the harm threatened to the actor in civilian countries “may well consistently reject duress as a defence to the killing of innocent persons on the ground that the proportionality requirement . . . is not met” (at para 68) (emphasis in original).

[163]                 The decision of Brooke LJ (approved by Ward LJ on this point) in the case of A (Children) (Conjoined Twins:  Surgical Separation), does suggest that there may be an exception to the rule in Dudley and Stephens for the defence of necessity in one of three cases:  (1) where there is no question of choosing who had to die; (2) when the innocent third party was taking some action that was imperiling the lives of others; or (3) it was a situation of a mors ineluctabilis, the innocent victim was “destined to die” (at p 1041) (see also JC Smith & Brian Hogan, Criminal Law, 7th ed (London, UK:  Butterworths, 1992) at 250-51; and Williams, “A Commentary on R v Dudley and Stephens” at p 96—the mountain climber hypothetical).

[164]                 While these comments are thought-provoking, they are best suited to the question of an external danger from a natural source as opposed to a human source.  It is difficult to see how the decision maker as to who lives or dies in the kill or be killed scenario, can be removed from the threatened party in a situation of duress.  In the case of A (Children) (Conjoined Twins:  Surgical Separation), it was the doctors who had conflicting legal duties in relation to the two girls, who made the choice of which conjoined twin would live and which one would die, and they sought judicial permission for their decision before operating on the two girls.  Also, the idea that an innocent party may imperil the life of a threatened party in some way also has no application in the situation of duress.  Finally, the idea of inescapable or inevitable death of an innocent person is also problematic in the defence of duress as Hall explains.  In my view, the comments of Brooke LJ in A (Children) (Conjoined Twins:  Surgical Separation) have to be taken in the context of the exceptional facts of that case.  The decision, when read carefully, is not at odds with the traditional rule that necessity is not a defence to murder as was decided in Dudley and Stephens (see Gary T Trotter (now Trotter JA), “Necessity and Death:  Lessons from Latimer and the Case of the Conjoined Twins” (2003) 40:4 Alta L Rev 826).

[165]                 The appellate authorities, save for Aravena (which I am not prepared to follow), are against the accused, that it can ever be proportionate to take one life to potentially save another.  The appellant’s argument “that it should not be assumed that the victim’s right to life is inherently more valuable than any right of an accused” is unpersuasive because, at its core, it is incongruous with respect for the universality of rights, which is the factor that needs to be considered in defining the parameters of the principles of fundamental justice.  While there may very well be situations of inescapable or inevitable death of an innocent person when the external danger is natural, the same is not the case when the threat comes from a human actor.  I reject the idea, for the reasons of Hall and Cardozo, that it will be certain that the innocent person will inevitably die in a case of duress, so the law can therefore absolve the actor who kills the innocent person.

[166]                 Leaving aside the obvious issue of the rights of an innocent third party to personal autonomy and life, there is also a societal interest that needs to be taken into consideration in defining the parameters of the proportionality component of moral involuntariness, because excusing the taking of innocent life is a controversial idea.  Professor Andrew Ashworth argues that if one individual could choose who lives and who dies, that “would be to regard the victim’s rights as [morally and politically] less worthy than the rights of those protected by the action taken, which represents a clear violation of the principle of individual autonomy” (Andrew Ashworth & Jeremy Horder, Principles of Criminal Law, 7th ed (Oxford, UK:  Oxford University Press, 2013) at 132).  He goes on to make the point that some situations make the protection of everyone’s autonomy impossible.

[167]                 Proportionality is the mechanism to determine the threshold of expected resistance of individuals facing external danger, so that a moral judgment can be made as to their culpability in surrendering to the external pressure (Fletcher at p 804).  Murder is a crime like no other.  The gap between the significant and certain harm that follows from murdering an innocent person, when compared to the uncertainties of a threat of another ever being carried out, or that the act of murder will be efficacious in releasing a threatened party from the external danger, is simply too great.  In my view, the gap between the harm inflicted and the benefit accrued by the act of murder is cavernous.  That conclusion, together with the important rights of the innocent person to personal autonomy and life as well as society’s interest in withholding the right to balance life against life, except in a case of self-defence, when the decision will affect the interests of the decision-maker, satisfies me that the trial judge was correct in deciding that the act of murdering an innocent person can never satisfy the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness, and thus allow for the offence of murder committed by a principal or co-principal to be excused.

Challenge to the Law on the Basis of Overbreadth

[168]                 Professor Hamish Stewart explains that, “It is a principle of fundamental justice that a law must not be overbroad in relation to its own purposes” (Hamish Stewart, Fundamental Justice:  Section 7 of The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Toronto:  Irwin Law, 2012) at 133; see also R v Heywood, 1994 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1994] 3 SCR 761).  Chief Justice McLachlin goes on to further explain in R v Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14 that, “Whether a law is overbroad within the meaning of s. 7 turns on the relationship between the law’s purpose and its effect:  R. v. Moriarity . . . at para 24” (at para 24).

[169]                 The accused argues that, instead of the statutory ban of the defence of duress to the offence of murder, Parliament could have chosen a less restrictive, but still effective, policy decision of allowing juries to consider the defence of duress based on the common law rules.  There is a bit of artificiality to this argument because until the Paquette decision, it was generally thought the rules of the common law and statutory versions of the defence of duress were the same (see R v Carker, 1966 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1967] SCR 114 at 117).  Nevertheless, he argues that we can expect that a properly instructed jury applying the strict requirements of the defence, as stated in Ryan, will ensure that there is no abuse of the defence.  The Court of Appeal in Aravena made the point, with which I agree, that there is no evidence to have concern that the proper administration and enforcement of the criminal law will be impeded by the alternative of juries deciding the question of duress (see para 79; and see Abbott at p 773).

[170]                 If one looks at the common law world, it is only in the United States where the concern that juries may have problems dealing with the defence of duress is openly acknowledged (although LeBel J does comment in Ruzic that, “Verification of a spurious claim of duress may prove difficult” (at para 59)).  In respect of American federal offences, absent statutory language to the contrary, and in some states, the burden of proof regarding the defence of duress is reversed to the accused on the preponderance of the evidence to establish duress based on the logic that the circumstances of duress lie peculiarly within an accused’s knowledge, making the defence otherwise too difficult for the prosecution to disprove (see Dixon v United States, 548 US 1 (2006) at 6.  Also see New Jersey—State v Toscano, 378 A (2d) 755 at 766 (NJ Sup Ct 1977); and Washington State—State of Washington v Riker, 869 P (2d) 43 at 52 (Wash Sup Ct 1994)).  A similar proposal has been made in England by the Law Commission but it has never been accepted (see the discussion in Hasan at paras 71-72 by Baroness Hale).

[171]                 The thrust of the accused’s submission is answered by Lord Hailsham in Howe as to why the defence of duress is not available for the offence of murder.  He states that, “The question is not one of the reliability of juries.  It is one of principle” (at p 434).  To me, the accused’s argument has merit and some attractiveness from a policy perspective.  It is also in keeping with the general approach of Canadian law that strength should be presumed from a properly instructed jury, not weakness (see the comments of Martin JA in Mena at para 45).  However, the question before this Court is limited to constitutional review of a different policy choice that has been made by Parliament.

[172]                 The Supreme Court of Canada explained the concept of overbreadth this way in Carter (at para 85):

 

The overbreadth inquiry asks whether a law that takes away rights in a way that generally supports the object of the law, goes too far by denying the rights of some individuals in a way that bears no relation to the object:  Bedford, [2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 SCR 1101] at paras. 101 and 112-13.  Like the other principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, overbreadth is not concerned with competing social interests or ancillary benefits to the general population.  A law that is drawn broadly to target conduct that bears no relation to its purpose “in order to make enforcement more practical” may therefore be overbroad (see Bedford, at para. 113).  The question is not whether Parliament has chosen the least restrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the person in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the legislature.  The focus is not on broad social impacts, but on the impact of the measure on the individuals whose life, liberty or security of the person is trammelled.

 

[173]                 If one applies those principles, the object of the law, as has been previously stated, is to prohibit the balancing life against life, except in a case of self-defence, when the decision will affect the interests of the decision-maker.  In terms of the effects of the challenged law, the impact affects only those charged with murder as a principal or co-principal, not a party (see Paquette).  Only the actual killer(s) cannot raise the defence of duress; there is no statutory restriction on someone who provides no more than peripheral assistance.  While the distinction between principals and parties for the purposes of duress has been historically decried as being illogical by many judges and scholars, there is some force to the distinction on an overbreadth analysis.  A good illustration of the overbreadth problem section 17 raises comes from Lord Morris’s reasonably foreseeable hypothetical stated in Lynch (at p 671):

 

Though it is not possible for the law always to be worked out on coldly logical lines there may be manifest factual differences and contrasts between the situation of an aider and abettor to a killing and that of the actual killer.  Let two situations be supposed.  In each let it be supposed that there is a real and effective threat of death.  In one a person is required under such duress to drive a car to a place or to carry a gun to a place with knowledge that at such place it is planned that X is to be killed by those who are imposing their will.  In the other situation let it be supposed that a person under such duress is told that he himself must there and then kill X.  In either situation there is a terrible agonizing choice of evils.  In the former to save his life the person drives the car or carries the gun.  He may cling to the hope that perhaps X will not be found at the place or that there will be a change of intention before the purpose is carried out or that in some unforeseen way the dire event of a killing will be averted.  The final and fatal moment of decision has not arrived.  He saves his own life at a time when the loss of another life is not a certainty.  In the second (if indeed it is a situation likely to arise) the person is told that to save his life he himself must personally there and then take an innocent life.  It is for him to pull the trigger or otherwise personally to do the act of killing.  There, I think, before allowing duress as a defence it may be that the law will have to call a halt.

 

[174]                 The hypothetical driver/gun courier, who we assume has the mens rea necessary to be liable for murder before turning to the question of duress (see R v Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13 at paras 16-18, [2010] 1 SCR 411), plays no role in deciding whether the innocent party lives or dies.  They do not select the victim, nor do they actually kill them.  If section 17 also applied to parties in addition to principals and co-principals, the law would curtail the defence of duress in a way unconnected to its purpose because someone like Lord Morris’s driver/gun courier did not choose to balance life against life.  While Paquette is a pre-Charter decision, it continues to have relevance, in my view, to the constitutionality of section 17 of the Code in light of the principle of fundamental justice that a law must not be overbroad.

[175]                 In summary, I would not accede to the overbreadth argument of the accused, as I am not satisfied that the challenged law is too broad in its effect.  Because it is limited to principals and co-principals, it does not capture conduct that bears no relation to its purpose (see Canada (Attorney General) v Bedford, 2013 SCC 72 at paras 112-33, [2013] 3 SCR 1101).

Conclusion

[176]                 A principal or co-principal charged with murder is not deprived of their section 7 Charter right to liberty in a manner that is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice of moral involuntariness or overbreadth by the statutory exclusion of the defence of duress.  In my view, the trial judge did not err in dismissing the accused’s Charter challenge to section 17 of the Code.

[177]                 In coming to the decision I have, I do not wish to convey the impression that the current state of the law of duress is not without complexity.  Cases like this one, where the identity of the principal is not in doubt, or a situation where the evidence is clear that a lethal assault resulted from common participation by more than one person, are not always going to be the case.  My concern is not the absurd situation, like the argument in Abbott, that holding a victim while she is stabbed by another and then burying her alive while she was dying, made the accused a party to the crime and not a co-principal.  I have confidence that trial judges will easily dispose of attempts to put square pegs in round holes.

[178]                 More difficult, however, will be those situations, as was discussed in Mena (see paras 37-43), where it is a debatable question on the evidence as to exactly what role an accused played in an offence, and whether they should be considered a principal or a party under section 21 of the Code.  While the distinction between a principal and a party is not relevant for proof of the offence, it is relevant as to whether the defence of duress can excuse a listed offence in section 17 of the Code, such as murder.

[179]                 Accordingly, in a case such as Mena, if there is an air of reality to the defence of duress, then the trial judge will have to instruct the jury that they will have to consider one and possibly a second further question if they decide that the Crown has proven the offence.  First, they will have to decide whether the defence of duress is open to the accused (i.e., has the Crown proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a principal or co-principal).  If the jury has a reasonable doubt that the accused was a principal to the offence, it will then have to go on to make a second decision as to whether the Crown has negated one or more of the requirements of the defence of duress beyond a reasonable doubt.  Unless the Crown negates at least one of the requirements of the defence of duress then the accused is excused from liability and is acquitted.  That is what the law is (see Prof Gerry A Ferguson & Mr Justice Michael R Dambrot, Canadian Criminal Jury Instructions, 4th ed (Vancouver:  Continuing Legal Education Society of British Columbia, 2005) vol 2 (loose-leaf update 2015) at paras 8.20.3-8.20.20).  What the law ought to be, I leave for those who are not required to defer to the decision of Parliament absent demonstration of a constitutional defect in the law (see the comments of Lord Lane CJ in R v Howe et al (1986), 83 Cr App R 28 (CA (Eng)) at 33).

[180]                 Given the following conclusion I have reached on the Crown’s alternative submission on the curative proviso, if the challenged law did violate section 7 of the Charter, it is unnecessary to consider section 1 of the Charter and the trial judge’s conclusions in the alternative to his section 7 finding.

Issue Two – Application of Curative Proviso (Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code)

Introduction

[181]                 The Crown argues that, if the trial judge erred in failing to find section 17 of the Code unconstitutional, the verdict would have been the same in this case if the error had not occurred because there was no air of reality to the accused’s claim of duress, given the common law requirements of the defence of duress (see section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code; Aravena at para 115; and R v Noureddine (C), 2015 ONCA 770 at para 100, 341 OAC 130).  The six requirements of the common law defence of duress were stated in Ryan to be (at para 81):

 

•        There must be an explicit or implicit threat of present or future death or bodily harm.  This threat can be directed at the accused or a third party.

 

•        The accused must reasonably believe that the threat will be carried out.

 

•        There is no safe avenue of escape.  This element is evaluated on a modified objective standard.

 

•        A close temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened.

 

•        Proportionality between the harm threatened and the harm inflicted by the accused.  The harm caused by the accused must be equal to or no greater than the harm threatened.  This is also evaluated on a modified objective standard.

 

•        The accused is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this criminal activity, conspiracy or association.

 

[182]                 It is only necessary to comment on whether there was an air of reality to two of the six requirements in this case:  no safe avenue of escape and no voluntary exposure to risk of duress by criminal association, in order to dispose of the Crown’s submission.

No Safe Avenue of Escape

[183]                 The test as to whether an individual has no safe avenue of escape is a modified objective test.  The Court explained it in Ryan this way (at para 65):

 

[A] reasonable person in the same situation as the accused and with the same personal characteristics and experience would conclude that there was no safe avenue of escape or legal alternative to committing the offence.  If a reasonable person similarly situated would think that there was a safe avenue of escape, the requirement is not met and the acts of the accused cannot be excused using the defence of duress because they cannot be considered as morally involuntary.

 

[184]                 The question of whether there was a safe avenue of escape that was reasonably open to an accused requires that the situation be examined based on an objective standard “adjusted for subjective circumstances” (see R v Keller (SR) (1998), 1998 ABCA 357 (CanLII), 228 AR 24 at para 24 (CA)).  Relevant factors to be considered are the personal circumstances of the accused (e.g., age, physical health or disability, recognized mental illness or psychiatric conditions), the particular circumstances the accused was in when threatened, including his or her perception of the threat and of the options to evade it, and the commensurate risks involved with either yielding to the threat or attempting to avoid it (see Ruzic at para 61; and R v Bowen, [1996] 2 Cr App R 157 (CA (Eng)) at 166-67).

[185]                 In considering the modified objective standard, the court has to guard against the error of getting carried away with the idea of “it’s all about context”.  It is permissible to consider individual context to inform the objective standard that encourages that wherever possible, individuals will act reasonably and nonviolently.  It is not permissible to use context to individualize the standard to such a degree as to render the objective component meaningless in a given case.

[186]                 Here, the accused’s statement to the police, that he thought contacting them about the threats to him and his family was not a feasible option, is not sufficient to give rise to an air of reality that he had no safe avenue of escape as that would be an entirely subjective standard (Keller at para 24).  The question is not what the reasonable criminal who is threatened would do similarly situated, but what the reasonable person would do, bearing in mind the accused’s situation.  Such a person does not view the world through the same lens as members of the criminal subculture do.  For a reasonable person, resorting to the nonviolent option of seeking assistance from the police is not an option that is to be dismissed out of hand.  As King CJ commented in R v Brown (1986), 43 SASR 33 (Sup Ct) the “ordinary way in which a citizen renders ineffective criminal intimidation is to report the intimidators and to seek the protection of the police” (at p 40).  As previously mentioned, to require otherwise, except in the exceptional case where no degree of police protection would be effective to counter the threat (see Brown), would remove entirely the reasonableness requirement of this ingredient of the defence of duress (see the similar comments of Doherty JA in R v Pilon (R), 2009 ONCA 248 at para 75, 247 OAC 127, as to the question of self-defence).

[187]                 I am unimpressed by the accused’s explanation that he was scared and thought contacting the police would make things “worse”.  That nonsensical explanation may explain his preference, however, as the Australian High Court has explained, “an unparticularised concern that police protection may not be a guarantee of safety cannot without more supply reasonable grounds for a belief that there is no option other than to break the law in order to escape the execution of a threat” (Taiapa v The Queen, [2009] HCA 53 at para 40 (AustLII)).

[188]                 If there is a reasonable opportunity where an individual can feasibly escape the proverbial gun to their head brought about by the threat of another, they must do so or forfeit any plea of duress (Regina v Sharp, [1987] 1 QB 853 (CA (Eng)) at 857).  Here, the accused had plenty of time both before and after his family was threatened to seek the protection of law enforcement (see Hasan at para 28; and Taiapa).  There was no close temporal connection between the threat and its execution to exclude the option of intervention by law enforcement.  There is also no reason to believe that law enforcement could not have intervened to protect the accused and his family (see Hudson and Taylor at p 207).  For example, it cannot be said that the rule of law had “broken down” in Winnipeg (Ruzic at para 3).  The accused was advised repeatedly to go to the police and chose not to do so.  He failed to turn to the police even when shot at, assaulted and had family members threatened.  The only inference available on the evidence is that he wished to continue to be a drug dealer; he must bear the consequences of that misguided decision.

[189]                 Where on the uncontested facts as is the case here, there is an “obviously safe avenue of escape” (Bergstrom at para 9) and “no reasonable jury could come to any other conclusion,” (Mena at para 60) the court is entitled as a matter of law to decide that the defence of duress is not available to an accused (see also para 54 of Bergstrom).

[190]                 There are other problems for the accused on the record as to the question of whether he had a safe avenue of escape, aside from the question of refusing to turn to law enforcement for assistance.  There was evidence before the jury, from the accused’s statement to police, that another individual, a man named Sunil Patel, had a similar debt problem with the same criminal organization.  The accused knew that when pressured to repay his own debt, Patel simply fled the jurisdiction to escape his difficulties.  That option was also realistic for the accused well before the threats escalated.  He was a single person with no dependents or other obligations, and he could have simply left Winnipeg, rather than stay and commit murder.

[191]                 Also after the murder, for the first time, the accused discussed with Sam-Kelly the idea of legal and illegal ways to raise money.  The two men talked about lawful ideas, like a loan from Sam-Kelly’s uncle or pawning goods, and the unlawful option of stealing a car and going to a chop shop.  The accused also approached Moslenko to obtain a loan.  The question is whether the accused had no realistic safe avenue of escape, short of committing murder, not just whether he had no “lawful” avenue of escape (R v Williams (TG), 2002 BCCA 453 at para 20, 171 BCAC 308).  The record here is the accused perceived he had many ways to raise money to stop the threats; a reasonable person in that situation would have exhausted those options before committing murder, not after.

[192]                 I accept the Crown’s submission that there was no air of reality to the claim that the accused had no safe avenue of escape from the threat he faced from the criminal organization other than to murder Ms Tran.

No Voluntary Exposure to Risk of Duress by Criminal Association

[193]                 A person who participates in a conspiracy or other criminal association with knowledge that their involvement brings with it the risk of being subject to coercion and/or threats to commit an offence cannot raise the defence of duress.  The standard of whether the accused had knowledge of the risk of being subject to coercion and/or threats to commit an offence is a subjective one (see Ryan at paras 75-80).

[194]                 The question of an accused’s knowledge of the risk of coercion and/or threats by their criminal association may be addressed by either direct, or likely indirect evidence.  In the case of the latter, certain objective facts viewed collectively will be important to consider, including:  the characteristics of the person or persons making the threat, the criminal activities in question and the nature and duration of the accused’s association with the person or persons making the threat.

[195]                 In this case, according to the accused’s statement to police, the drug-trafficking criminal organization had been operating before the accused joined it approximately one year prior to the murder.  The members of the group were not amateurs; they were trafficking cocaine throughout Manitoba.  According to the accused, Sunil Patel was trafficking cocaine in two urban centres in Manitoba, The Pas and Thompson, based on cocaine supplied by Fenali from Winnipeg (that the accused delivered).  The quantities of drugs involved were not insignificant.  On one occasion, Sunil Patel lost a kilogram of cocaine in Thompson, Manitoba.  Regardless of whether you believe Fenali or Moslenko masterminded the murder of Ms Tran, the group was also prepared to have threats to it eliminated.  Sam-Kelly testified that the accused told him he had “to rub somebody out in order to get paid.”  The police asked the accused why he was worried about the threats of being killed by the criminal organization and he replied because “they’ve done it before.”  This is not surprising because violence and the drug trade go hand in hand.

[196]                 The defence of duress, whether it be in its statutory form or common law one, is not available to an individual who voluntarily puts him or herself in harm’s way aware of the risks such a decision may bring.  As Stromberg-Stein J (as she then was) explained in R v Poon (BHC) et al, 2006 BCSC 1158, [2006] BCTC 1158 (at para 17):

 

It would make a mockery of justice to put in front of the jury the claims of those who make deals with the devil, who claim they have no alternative, and who ask the court to insulate their illegal activities.

 

[197]                 In Ruzic (see para 70), the Supreme Court of Canada cited with approval the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Heath, [1999] EWCA Crim 1526 (BAILII).  In that decision, the Court denied the defence of duress to an accused, in part, because he was aware that becoming indebted to a drug supplier exposed him to unlawful violence because of the violent nature of the drug world.  Unlike here, the accused in Heath was far less involved in the ongoing activities of the illicit drug network.  The accused in Heath was only a customer who became indebted and then was coerced to commit an offence to repay, in part, his drug debt.

[198]                 Here, the record is clear that the accused knew about the violent nature of his criminal associates, and yet continued to associate with them.  When one considers the statement of the accused to the police as a whole, there is also no suggestion of surprise by the accused that he was subject to coercion and/or threats to commit a violent crime over the drug debt:  in fact, quite the opposite.  There is also nothing from the evidence of Sam-Kelly or other witnesses to suggest otherwise.  The only inference that the record can reasonably support is that the accused had actual knowledge of the risk of duress when he made the voluntary choice to associate with the drug-trafficking criminal organization.  Accordingly, the defence of duress was not open to him (see Sharp at pp 855, 860-61; R v Lewis (1992), 96 Cr App R 412 (CA (Eng)) at 417; Heath; and R v Li (B) et al (2002), 2002 CanLII 18077 (ON CA), 156 OAC 364 at para 20 (CA)).

[199]                 In coming to this decision, it is important to bear in mind that the accused did not testify to provide further context to his state of mind beyond what was in his statement to police or conversations he had with witnesses.  Of course, an accused’s silence at trial has no evidentiary value, but in the face of such silence, the record on appeal must be evaluated without regard to any explanation that cannot arise from the facts themselves (R v Noble, 1997 CanLII 388 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 874 at paras 79, 82, 86-87).

[200]                 I accept the Crown’s submission that the accused voluntarily exposed himself to the risk of duress by participating in the criminal organization with Fenali and others and, accordingly, the defence of duress was not open to him.

Conclusion

[201]                 The ultimate consideration for the curative proviso is the evidence heard by the jury, not the possible evidence the accused might have adduced if the defence of duress was not statutorily barred by section 17 of the Code (see R v James (R), 2011 ONCA 839 at para 56, 287 OAC 18).  In this case, there was a live issue prior to the trial as to whether the accused had standing to challenge section 17 of the Code.  The accused put forward no evidence on his constitutional application that section 17 of the Code was, as the trial judge put it, “engaged” in this case (at para 6).  The Crown argued that, because of this lack of evidence, the accused had no standing to bring the application as the entire issue was “hypothetical”.  The trial judge only permitted the accused to bring his constitutional application at all because he made a pre-trial ruling that the accused’s statement to police was voluntary and the Crown intended to introduce it at trial as evidence.  That statement provided an air of reality to some, but not all, of the requirements of the defence of duress.

[202]                 I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated that the accused’s conviction for first degree murder should stand in the event that the trial judge erred in not finding section 17 of the Code unconstitutional.  There is no air of reality to the defence of duress in this case taking into account the six requirements of that defence at common law as set out in Ryan.  In my view, there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the error not been made (see R v Bevan, 1993 CanLII 101 (SCC), [1993] 2 SCR 599 at 617; and R v Khan, 2001 SCC 86 at para 28, [2001] 3 SCR 823).

Issue Three – Instructions on the Common Sense Inference and Intoxication

[203]                 At the hearing of the appeal, the Court did not call on the Crown to address this ground of appeal, as we determined that it had no merit.

[204]                 To begin, the circumstances here are such that considerable weight must be given to the fact that there was no objection to the jury instructions on the effect of evidence of intoxication as to the common sense inference the jury could draw in deciding the accused’s state of mind from his actions for the purposes of deciding whether he had the requisite state of mind to be convicted of murder (see section 229(a) of the Code).  The record is clear that defence counsel was content with the proposed jury instructions before the trial judge gave them; the complaint is now being raised for the first time on appeal making such objection unlikely to succeed (see R v Pearce (ML), 2014 MBCA 70 at para 143, 310 ManR (2d) 14).  The other related concern is that the evidence the jury heard about the accused’s intoxication at the time of the offence was “not extensive,” nor, would I add, seemingly compelling (R v Chretien (E), 2014 ONCA 403 at para 97, 321 OAC 150).

[205]                 Notwithstanding those concerns, in my view, the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the common sense inference in deciding the question of the accused’s state of mind, in light of the evidence they heard about possible intoxication, were balanced, fair and without error (see R v Seymour, 1996 CanLII 201 (SCC), [1996] 2 SCR 252 at paras 19-23; R v Daley, 2007 SCC 53 at paras 48-51, [2007] 3 SCR 523; R v Walle, 2012 SCC 41 at paras 57-67, [2012] 2 SCR 438; and R v Teerhuis-Moar (S), 2010 MBCA 102 at paras 44-47, 258 ManR (2d) 290, leave to appeal to the SCC refused, 2011 CanLII 28462).

[206]                 The trial judge properly summarized the evidence that could realistically bear on the question of the accused’s state of mind.  He properly explained that the common sense inference was not a conclusion that the jury “must reach”, nor was it the only method they could use to determine whether the accused had one or the other of the requisite intents for murder required by section 229(a) of the Code.  Correctly, he further explained that before drawing the common sense inference, the jury must consider and weigh all of the evidence they heard about the accused’s state of mind before, during and after the stabbing, including the evidence they heard about his consumption of MDMA.  Finally, he properly explained that if they had a reasonable doubt about the accused’s intent due to consumption of MDMA, they could not rely on the common sense inference and must acquit the accused of murder and return a verdict of manslaughter.

[207]                 I fail to see how these instructions on a functional review in light of the entire record can be said to be inadequate.

Issue Four– Adequacy of the Answer to the Jury’s Question

Background

[208]                 In his original charge, the trial judge told the jury that one of the decisions it had to make was whether the murder of Ms Tran was both “planned” and “deliberate.”  No objection is taken to the instructions he provided as to the meaning of planning and deliberation, or that each of those requirements had to be proven separately in order for the jury to reach a guilty verdict on first degree murder as opposed to second degree murder (see section 231(2) of the Code).

[209]                 The trial judge made the following comment to the jury as to deciding the separate questions of planning and deliberation:

 

It is for you to say . . . whether the murder of Kaila Tran was both planned and deliberate.

 

To decide this issue you should consider all of the evidence.  That evidence may include that which was said or done in the period leading up to the stabbing . . . that which was done or said at the time of the stabbing and/or that which was done or said following the stabbing.

 

[210]                 He then went on to review some of the relevant evidence.  One fact he did not raise with the jury, at this point in his charge, was the evidence they heard as to the accused’s consumption of MDMA, what Sam-Kelly called in his testimony “Molly” prior to the stabbing of Ms Tran.  However, earlier in his charge, on the question of deciding whether the accused had the requisite state of mind required for murder, the trial judge reviewed in detail the evidence as to the accused’s consumption of MDMA on the morning of the offence.

[211]                 When the jury retired to deliberate, they had a written copy of the jury charge as well as a decision tree to assist in their deliberations.

[212]                 On the morning of the second day of their deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking the following question:

 

Could you please clarify how an action can be planned but not deliberate?  i.e. How can they be separate?

 

Can you give an example of a crime that is planned but not deliberate.

 

Thanks !

 

#5 Foreman

 

[213]                 The trial judge reviewed the question with counsel and after receiving their input and agreement as to a proposed answer, he recalled the jury and instructed them as follows:

 

Ladies and gentlemen, you’ve patiently awaited the response to your question.  I thank you for your patience.  I’ve had the opportunity to speak to counsel and get their feedback and I’ve provided them mine.  The reason for the delay was the question came not too long before lunch, and I wanted to make sure we had lots of time to consider and reflect on the question, and I didn’t want that reflection and consideration to run into your lunch hour.  I know you’ve been working very hard, so I apologize for the delay, but I think it was perhaps well planned, or well timed.

 

Let me read into the record the question that I’ve received from you:  Could you please clarify how an action can be planned, but not deliberate; ie. how can they be separate?  Can you give an example of a crime that is planned but not deliberate?

 

Now, ladies and gentlemen, your question addresses the meaning of planning and deliberation, and the degree to which they are separate and distinct.  Ladies and gentlemen, despite what might seem like some overlapping and perhaps some confusing aspects to the definition of each concept, planning and deliberation, the two concepts are, as I explained in my instructions, distinct concepts, each with their own meaning.

 

While I take your question as a serious question, to decide this case, it is not necessary for you or I, or for counsel to determine whether an action can be planned, but not deliberate.  What is necessary and important in this case is for you to keep in mind, even with what might be some overlap, the two distinct definitions that apply to the concept of planning and deliberation.

 

It is also important and necessary for you to keep in mind that a murder, for it to be first degree murder, must be a murder that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that contains both planning and deliberation.  Keep in mind my final instructions to you, where I set out the definitions and meanings of each concept, and it begins at the bottom of page 98 and runs to page 101 of my instructions.

 

Now, keep in mind as well, ladies and gentlemen, that an action is a planned action, if it has been previously conceived, formulated, or designed.  An action is a planned action if it was conceived before the action was carried out.  An action committed on a sudden impulse without prior consideration, even with intention, is not a planned action.

 

For example, a person may get into an argument with someone, lose their temper and intentionally kill that person on the spur of the moment.  In that example, the murder was intentional but not planned.  I repeat, a planned action is an action that was conceived or designed before it was carried out.

 

Now, the word deliberate also means something more than intentional.  It means an action that was carried out after careful thought, real consideration, and where the person weighed advantages and disadvantages.  It is not a deliberate action if the action was done suddenly, on the spur of the moment, impulsively, hastily or rashly.

 

Now, in determining whether there was both planning and deliberation in this case, consider, as I said to you all long, all of the evidence.  All of the evidence that you saw and heard.  Including, of course, the evidence respecting the amount, the amount of Molly consumed as it relates to the accused’s mental state, but also the evidence of his video statement to the police, wherein he admits to having killed Kaila Tran, and wherein he provides in an accompanying explanation as to how that killing came about.  Consider as well his conversations with Tremaine Sam-Kelly, and his statement to Sasha Sinanan.

 

Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that’s the response to the question.  I’m hoping it’s helpful to you.  Again, I appreciate the hard work.  We’ll leave you at that, and if you have any further questions, you can pose them.  Until we hear anything further from you, we’ll just wait, okay?  Thank you for your patience.

 

[emphasis added]

 

[214]                 The jury then retired and continued deliberating without asking any further questions for just over four hours, before returning to the courtroom and announcing their guilty verdict.

[215]                 The accused says that the trial judge’s response to the question was inadequate, because it did not properly clarify how an action can be planned but not deliberate, it did not provide an example of such a situation and it erroneously suggested that planning and deliberation are one and the same idea.  He also argues that the jury was not encouraged to ask further questions, and thus, was left without the necessary help to continue deliberating and was in a state of confusion.

Analysis and Decision

[216]                 This ground of appeal raises the question of whether taking a functional approach to the trial judge’s charge and recharge left the jury with an erroneous view of the distinction between the concepts of planning and deliberation that section 231(2) of the Code requires be independently proven for a murder to be first degree murder, as opposed to second degree murder (see R v S (WD), 1994 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1994] 3 SCR 521 at 530; and R v Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 314 at para 32).

[217]                 The law is well settled that a trial judge must provide a “responsive answer” to a question from the jury during their deliberations (R v Layton, 2009 SCC 36 at para 33, [2009] 2 SCR 540).  That entails a response that is clear, correct and comprehensive to the substance of the jury’s query (see S (WD) at 528).  The simplicity of this legal obligation masks the practical difficulty in successfully performing it in a given case.  There is no catechism of established answers for trial judges as no two juries’ questions are alike.  This is a judicial function that relies entirely on the proper exercise of discretion tailored to the applicable circumstances (see R v Ponce; R v Tavares, 2012 MBCA 87 at para 94).

[218]                 The accused relies on the decision of More v The Queen, 1963 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1963] SCR 522, as an example of when a murder can be planned, but not deliberate.  He argues that, as in More, the effect of the trial judge’s charge and recharge here was to create confusion for the jury in the distinction between planning and deliberation.

[219]                 In More, the accused was in a severe state of depression over his financial difficulties.  He decided to kill his wife and then take his own life.  A few days after obtaining a firearm and ammunition, he woke up in the middle of the night and began to brood about his problems.  He then shot his sleeping wife, killing her instantly, and then shot himself in the head, in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.  He testified that before discharging the firearm, he thought the shooting would allow them to get to a “better place . . . [without] money problems” (at p 536).  Two psychiatrists testified that, at the relevant time, the accused suffered from a depressive psychosis that impaired his ability to think, reason and decide.

[220]                 Although the trial judge in More correctly explained the concepts of planning and deliberation to the jury, and that they were separate requirements that each must be independently proven, he misdirected the jury by telling them to give little weight to the expert opinion of the psychiatrists in reaching a verdict.

[221]                 Cartwright J (as he then was) explained this misdirection was a significant error because the evidence of the accused and the psychiatrists left it “open to the jury to take the view that the act of the appellant in pulling the trigger was impulsive rather than considered and therefore was not deliberate” (at p 534).

[222]                 I have not been persuaded that there is a parallel between this case and More, as the latter was a situation where there was a misdirection to the jury in the original charge, that was never corrected, on the distinction between proof of planning and deliberation (see Jacquard at para 39).  Here, the trial judge did not make an “unwarranted disparagement” of the evidence in his original charge or the recharge relevant to proof of deliberation that had the effect of withdrawing a defence to first degree murder from the jury (see More at p 538).

[223]                 With the consent and encouragement of defence counsel, in his response to the jury’s question, the trial judge repeated his explanation as to the difference in law between the meanings of planning and deliberation and the requirement that each must be separately proven before a guilty verdict for first degree, as opposed to second degree, murder could be reached.  In the interplay between counsel and the trial judge in fashioning an answer to the jury’s question, defence counsel expressed caution to the trial judge in doing anything more than simply restating the principles that the jury had to consider.  She stated:

 

My concern about trying to draw out particular pieces of evidence is there has been a very thorough review in a very comprehensive charge, and I would worry that by trying to pick out certain select pieces of the evidence to relate to this question, there might be a danger in overemphasizing those particular matters.  My, my suggestion would be, and I would prefer that the court stick with the concepts and, you know, just maybe clarify by way of the guiding principles.

 

[224]                 The trial judge did not, however, simply repeat his original charge on planning and deliberation, which may not have dispelled any confusion that jury members may have had, because they had a written copy of the original charge (see Layton at paras 23-24).  He told counsel, outside the presence of the jury, that in his view, “they want and deserve something more.”

[225]                 The trial judge decided that it would be wise in his answer to make reference to the evidence of the accused’s state of mind at the time of the murder because even if it did not meet the “[Daley] standard” (see Daley), it might, as he put it, “have impacted on the question of deliberation.”  In his response, the trial judge told the jury to consider the evidence of the accused’s consumption of MDMA (i.e., Molly) on whether the murder was both planned and deliberate.  No objection was taken to this course of action and the approach of the trial judge was, in my view, appropriate and helpful to the jury, as he made it clear to them that they should consider the relevant evidence of the accused’s intoxication twice—first, as to the question of the accused having the requisite state of mind for murder; and second, as to the question of whether the murder was both planned and deliberate (see R v Wallen, 1990 CanLII 146 (SCC), [1990] 1 SCR 827 at 844 per McLachlin J (as she then was) in dissent, but not on this point).

[226]                 The accused goes on to suggest that the trial judge’s comment, “[I]t is not necessary for you or I or counsel to determine whether an action can be planned, but not deliberate” was a misdirection to the jury that the two concepts are intrinsically linked.  He says that the comment amounts to an instruction to the jury that, if they were satisfied that the murder was planned, they must also find necessarily it was deliberate.  In support of this argument, he relies on certain comments of the trial judge, outside the presence of the jury, where he says the trial judge rejected the idea that an action can be planned but not deliberate.

[227]                 There are several problems with this argument.

[228]                 To begin, I do not see how the jury could have misunderstood that the concepts of planning and deliberation were not separate requirements, that each must be independently proven for a guilty verdict for first degree murder as opposed to second degree murder.  The jury was told that several times in the original charge and the recharge.

[229]                 The circumstances of the trial judge’s comment to the jury, that the accused now objects to for the first time on appeal, as to what they need not “determine” are important.  When read in its proper context, the trial judge’s comment is nothing more than a reminder to the jury about their role and the burden of proof in deciding separate requirements of first degree murder.  He told them that their task was not to decide whether the killing of Ms Tran was planned but not deliberate.  The next several sentences of his recharge make it clear to the jury that their task was to keep the two concepts of planning and deliberation separate, and decide whether there was a reasonable doubt as to whether either had been proven.  I see no misdirection with that instruction.

[230]                 I also have not been convinced that the trial judge, as counsel puts it their factum, expressed “disagreement” with the law, during discussions outside the presence of the jury, that an action can be planned but not deliberate.

[231]                 A review of the transcript confirms that all the trial judge did was express some informal comments to counsel, in light of the evidence in the trial as to what the jury’s confusion might be, as part of his dialogue with counsel in crafting a proper response to the jury’s question.  The jury never heard these musings of the trial judge, and so I do not see how they can amount to a reversible error, if they are taken to be anything more than the judge simply thinking out loud.  To that end, I would note counsel raised no objection at the time to the trial judge’s comments.  What is important on appeal, is that the jury was correctly instructed in a clear and comprehensive manner that the concepts of planning and deliberation are separate and distinct requirements and that each must be independently proven before a verdict for first degree murder could be reached.

[232]                 The next argument of the accused is that the trial judge erred by failing to give the jury an example of when a crime can be planned but not deliberate, as they had requested in their question.  In his discussions with counsel on a proposed answer to the jury’s question, the trial judge stated that giving the jury an example of a crime that can be planned but not deliberate might be a journey into “dangerous territory.”  He went on to say that he was not inclined to give the requested example because he did not think it would be “helpful” to the jury.

[233]                 An answer to a jury’s question is not inadequate merely on the basis of a trial judge exercising his or her discretion to not give an example of a legal concept, even where one is requested (see R v Miljevic, 2011 SCC 8 at para 2, [2011] 1 SCR 203).  It is the substance of the answer to the jury’s question that is important, not the form that it takes.  Trial judges should eschew taking a “stark linguistic approach” to answering a jury’s question (Ramstead v The Queen, [1999] 2 AC 92 at 105 (PC) per Hobhouse and Millett LJJ in dissent, but not on this point).  Rather, taking a contextual approach, a trial judge should provide the necessary assistance to the jury for it to resolve its confusion; nothing more and nothing less.  The law does not require that every part of a jury’s question necessarily be answered because such formalism has the risk of creating mischief in jury deliberations by the jury considering irrelevant matters or, worse, the trial judge’s answer having the effect of usurping the jury’s function.

[234]                 It is well accepted that answers to a jury’s questions are “extremely important” and influential to any ultimate verdict (R v Naglik, 1993 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 122 at 139).  In his discussions with counsel, the trial judge correctly pointed out that first degree murder is “unlike” other offences because of the special statutory requirements that must be proven.  Accordingly, giving the jury an example of a crime that is planned but not deliberate served no purpose.

[235]                 It is noteworthy that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the accused was denied a fair trial by his counsel’s position on what would be a responsive answer to the jury’s question.  Defence counsel was well positioned to know at this juncture of the trial what approach was in the best interests of the accused, in light of the law and the evidence the jury heard.  In crafting a response to the jury’s question, both defence counsel and the trial judge raised the legitimate concern of not wanting too much said in response to the jury’s question beyond restating the relevant definitions of planning and deliberation and how both must be independently proven.  Appropriately, the trial judge restated the governing legal principles and then directed the jury to the relevant evidence which included, unlike the original charge, the accused’s consumption of MDMA before committing the offence.

[236]                 In my view, counsel’s agreement that the proposed answer of the trial judge was responsive to the jury’s question, despite not containing an example of a crime that is planned but not deliberate, is a circumstance that should be given significant weight in deciding this appeal, because defence counsel had a chance to comment on the proposed answer before it was given (see Jacquard at para 38; R v Nodrick (SD), 2012 MBCA 61 at paras 24-27, 280 ManR (2d) 223; and R v WM (1997), 91 BCAC 148 at para 55).  I see no reason in these circumstances to interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of discretion as to crafting a response to the jury’s question that did not include the example requested.

[237]                 Finally, in his response to the question, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that if they had any further questions, they could ask them.  Despite the accused’s submission to the contrary, this is not a case where the trial judge failed to give a responsive answer to a jury’s question and then discouraged the jury from asking more questions, leading to the possibility that their confusion would never be addressed (see Layton at paras 30-31).  I see no reason not to trust the common sense expected of the jury that, if the answer they received was not helpful they would have simply taken up the trial judge’s invitation to “pose” another one.  I see nothing in the trial judge’s comments which closed the door to the jury receiving further assistance, if they so wished.

[238]                 In conclusion, I am satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury misunderstood the distinction between planning and deliberation, and that both had to be proven separately in order for the jury to return a verdict of guilty for first degree murder as opposed to second degree murder.
