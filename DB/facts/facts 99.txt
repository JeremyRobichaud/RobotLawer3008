[5]               The background facts in this case are not in dispute and are relevant respecting the relationship between Mr. Deer and Mr. Beauchamp, and Mr. Deer and Mr. Karim. The following facts are findings of fact I have made from the uncontroverted evidence.

 

[6]               In 2005, Mr. Deer was a principal in two companies – CDO Financial Group and Remington International Corporation. Remington International had a division, Remington Ground Thaw Services, that amongst other things did landscaping.

 


[7]               In April 2005 Mr. Karim and a friend Jimmy went to Cash Corner in Calgary to seek employment for the day. At Cash Corner, Jimmy and Mr. Karim got into a vehicle driven by Mr. Deer and did landscaping work for him that day. Based on the financial records of Remington Ground Thaw Services, I find this was Wednesday, April 30, 2005.

 

[8]               After this first work day, Mr. Karim began to work almost daily for Remington Ground Thaw Services until the end of August 2005, and thereafter sporadically. A friendship developed between Mr. Karim and Mr. Deer even though Mr. Deer was “the boss”. For example, Mr. Deer offered Mr. Karim a place to live in the basement of one of his supervisor’s homes and the two men socialized together along with other of Mr. Deer’s employees and family members. Mr. Karim described Mr. Deer as “being like a father to him”.

 

[9]               Once the landscaping work finished for the season in 2005, Mr. Karim moved out of his supervisor’s home, and later moved to Edmonton.

 

[10]           In October 2005, a mortgage broker brought an application by CDO Financial Group to Morbank for the financing of a construction project it was wishing to pursue in northwest Calgary. Mr. Deer was one of three principals in CDO Financial Group and he paid a $2,000.00 deposit on the commitment fee for the financing to Morbank on behalf of CDO. Morbank analysed the financial information respecting the construction project and concluded it would not finance the project as structured. However, Mr. Beauchamp asked Valerie Zimmer, a Morbank employee involved in this process, to set up a meeting with Mr. Deer to discuss the project.

 

[11]           A meeting occurred between Mr. Beauchamp, Ms. Zimmer and Mr. Deer. I find this meeting took place on November 24, 2005 based on the emails and appointments seized from Mr. Deer’s computer. At the meeting, Mr. Beauchamp explained Morbank’s position it would not finance the project as structured, but told Mr. Deer Morbank was willing to work with him so long as the cost of the project could be reduced. The meeting concluded with Mr. Deer having to revise his budget if he wished Morbank to consider financing the project.

 

[12]           Ms. Zimmer described the meeting this way:

 

Q         ...What was the tone or level of emotion at the meeting?

A         The tone, it was – the tone was, you know, Jack – Mr. Beauchamp, you know, when it came to finances and it came to protecting his investors, the tone of the meeting, he just made sure that there was no room for misinterpretation. So he was jut very black and white. There was no emotion into the meeting, but it was just based on the project itself. It had nothing to do with anybody or any person or anything like that. It was strictly black and white. It was numbers only.

 

...

 

Q         Now, the third person there that you’ve referred to as Mr. Deer, what was his emotions like at the meeting?


A         Of course he wasn’t pleased to hear, you know, what Mr. Beauchamp had to say, so he, you know, tried very hard to argue his point. But, unfortunately, it just didn’t change the dynamics of the file.

 

[13]           I find Mr. Deer made the following note in his appointment calendar on his computer after the meeting with Mr. Beauchamp and Ms. Zimmer:

 

Jack was, abnoxious [sic] letting me know who was boss! Val said nothing. Appraisal came in below cost, so they cannot approve the project. May reconsider if 15% profit was not spent on a GC.

 

[14]           After the meeting Ms. Zimmer followed up with Mr. Deer, and he submitted a revised application to Morbank with his company, Remington International Corporation, being the borrower. In addition, he sought the $2,000.00 deposit from the first application be transferred to the revised application.

 

[15]           Mr. Beauchamp issued a new commitment letter for the financing of the project to Remington on December 7, 2005 based on the revised application.

 

[16]           Later that afternoon, I find Mr. Deer sent an email with an attached letter to Mr. Beauchamp, cc’d to Ms. Zimmer, respecting the financing proposal set out in the commitment letter. Mr. Deer wrote:

 

Jack,

 

I have received your Finance proposal, and am reviewing it with interest. I do however, have a question;

 

I can only surmise that the Commitment fee in Item 11 of your Commitment letter is based on the $18,055.00 originally calculated for CDO on the numbers submitted by them. From that it appears that the $2,000.00 deposit has been deducted, leaving a balance of $16,055.00 owing. Is that correct?

 

That appears to be the case because the original loan applied for was $1,203,635.00 and a fee of 1.5% equaled $18,055.00

 

This revised loan application for the same project offers more owner equity and less financing, so I require a revised application fee. The new loan amount is for a maximum of $949,115.00 (which is more than my budget called for), but in any event a fee of 1.5% would be $14,237.00. From that fee, I would ask that the $2,000.00 already received by you be credited to the continuance of this project.

 

The agreed Brokerage Fee is also 1.5%, so we will be changing Item 12 to that figure as well.

 


Please reply to all concerned that we have this agreement, and I will continue to review and approve your proposal.

 

Thanks,

 

Bob Deer

Remington International Corporation

 

[17]           About two hours later, I find Mr. Deer sent Ms. Zimmer the following email:

 

Hi Val,

Thanks for confirming by phone that the $2,000.00 already paid by me on the CDO file has been transferred to the Remington file. I was hoping to receive an e-mail to that effect as well because I am to meet with my mortgage broker at 6:00 P.M. tonight, and I want to confirm with him that the project is continuing, albeit with new numbers, and a new entity. If you are able to e-mail me before you go home today, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks, Bob Deer

 

[18]           The following day, Mr. Beauchamp replied to Mr. Deer’s letter respecting the commitment letter:

 

You are correct in figuring out our calculation of the application fee. It is owed regardless of whether or not you accept this new commitment. If you accept this commitment you are getting a break as we are not charging you a new commitment fee for this new commitment letter. If you make any changes to this commitment letter without my agreement in advance, the commitment letter will become void.

 

I suggest you call me to discuss this rather than corresponding by e-mail on such a serious matter.

 

Jack Beauchamp

 

[19]           This email appears to have precipitated the series of threatening emails and telephone calls between Mr. Beauchamp and Mr. Deer that followed over the next weeks, which ultimately lead to the events of January 15 and 16, 2006.

 

[20]           Mr. Deer emailed the following reply to Mr. Beauchamp on December 8, 2005:

 

Jack,

 

I will not phone you because you have lied to me before. I will correspond with you in writing only, because I now require evidence of everything that we say to each other.


...

 

The problem was that the appraisal came in lower than expected, and you then told me that the deal would not work, and that you were backing away from your commitment. At the same time, you told me that your fee of $18,055.00 was duly earned and payable. Only gangsters talk like that!

 

...

 

In all correspondence, you refer to this as a “revised” loan application, which means that our entire process is a continuance, and that we have details to resolve, but that we are both interested in this very valid project. I am an honest business man, and I do business with honest people. When you write me an e-mail telling me that I am “getting a break as we are not charging you a new commitment fee”, I hear a gangster talking again. You and I both know that you have not earned my business yet!

 

If you care to do some honest business with me, I will gladly offer a construction project mortgage to you. Until then, back away from your “strong arm” tactics, because I don’t do business that way.

 

Please review your position, and let me know if we can continue this project together. [emphasis added]

 

Sincerely,

Bob Deer

 

[21]           I infer Mr. Beauchamp retracted or cancelled Morbank’s letter of commitment respecting the financing of Mr. Deer’s construction project as a result of the above letter. This inference is based upon Mr. Deer’s email to Mr. Beauchamp on December 12.

 

[22]           In reply to the retraction, Mr. Deer sent the following email on December 12:

 

December 12, 2005

 

 

Jack,

 


Your letter of December 9, 2005 further proves that you have never committed to financing this project in the first place. What I mean by that is that in the 24 hour period between your last “Commitment Letter” which I received on December 8th and your retraction of that “commitment” on the 9th, nothing changed in the validity of the project or in financing criteria. The only thing that changed was that your feelings were hurt and you were pouting like a child because I was rejecting your “strong arm”, unethical business idea of trying to charge me a full fee for a project that you never approved financing for in the first place.

 

...

 

You say in your letter that you “...will be pursuing payment of these fees in full within our legal rights...” and so I must tell you that I would have a hard time believing that you would find a court in this country that would find your practice just or fair. You know in your heart that your ethics are in the mud, and that you will have to answer to that some day. My mother told me some 45 years ago that if a man lives by the sword, he should expect to die by the sword. I guess a more modern translation might sound like “if you live like a gangster, you should expect to die like a gangster.”

 

Don’t think for a minute that I am threatening you, because I am not. That is not the life I lead. I am merely suggesting that your practice of suing people for fees that are not owed, on projects that have never begun because of your childish nature is absurd. How well do you research your clients? Are you aware that some of them may not stand idly by, while you steal money from them? Do you realize that someone could hurt you or your business for operating with such unethical, low-life standards?

 

Kindly govern your actions accordingly. [emphasis added]

 

Yours Very Truly,

 

Bob Deer

 

[23]           It appears Mr. Beauchamp telephoned Mr. Deer as a result of the email of December 12. In addition, Mr. Beauchamp called the Calgary Police Service complaint line on December 14, 2005 with respect to Mr. Deer’s emails, including the email of December 12, 2005 but nothing came of the complaint.

 

[24]           Mr. Deer sent another email to Mr. Beauchamp on December 15, 2005 at 10:11 a.m. in response to Mr. Beauchamp’s telephone call:

 

Good Morning Jack,

 


I apologize for wording my letter to you in such a way that it scared you, or seemed to threaten you in any way. I mean no harm to you personally, as I don’t even know you. Simply, I was expressing my disgust in your company’s unethical business practices. The best case scenario is for both of us to close our files with each other, and get on with life. I do not like your threatening phone calls any more than you like my letters. I believe that you think that the content of your calls are less traceable than my written word. The difference is that you are a low life coward, and I am prepared to answer and explain everything that I say or do. I put everything in writing.

 

I would highly recommend that we end this situation immediately, or you’re right, it will get ugly. There is no need for that. Currently your secret is safe. I will say nothing to anyone. If you choose to pursue me and this file, you will have a “hornet’s nest” to deal with. The media will tear your company apart. Stop NOW! And do not call me any more! We can both walk away from this without getting hurt. It’s up to you.

 

Bob Deer

 

[25]           Mr. Beauchamp replied one hour later as follows:

 

The difference between us is that you are the low life coward.

 

You are so scared of discussing this in person like rational people that you hide behind your e-mails.

 

You feel that putting it in writing gives you license to hurl insults at me and my company. Let’s see how long it takes you to cross the line into slander. I am not about to sit by when that happens.

 

If you had any brains at all, you might understand simple contract law. You and your partners signed a contract with us and were unable or unwilling to live up to your part of the contract. If you are too stupid to understand what that means, ask someone. Apparently signing your name to anything means nothing. Your word is worthless in our opinion and therefore in the opinion of the lending marketplace.

 

Morbank on the other hand, puts all of its agreements formally in writing and is always fully prepared to stand behind our written agreements. Go ahead, and challenge our agreements in front of a Court if you disagree.

 

Stop with the threatening rhetoric and veiled threats. First off, I’m not the least bit intimidated or afraid of you. Second, you are not smart enough to pull off a war of words. Third, you are embarrassing yourself, in front of my lawyer, your old partners, the mortgage broker, my staff and now the police.

 

Maybe its time you grew up moron.

 

If you want to discuss this in person, if you have the courage, please call. Otherwise, do not contact me anymore.

 

Jack Beauchamp

 


[26]           I find Mr. Deer telephoned Morbank on at least two other occasions after the last email. For example, between Christmas and December 31, 2005, Mr. Deer called Morbank asking to speak to Mr. Beauchamp. I accept the evidence of Calvin Volk, who spoke to Mr. Deer, that Mr. Deer was irate that Mr. Beauchamp had not returned his earlier call or calls and was adamant he wished to speak to Mr. Beauchamp. Mr. Volk took the message and gave it to Mr. Beauchamp January 3, 2006; it appears Mr. Beauchamp did not return the call.

 

Mr. Karim’s December visit to Calgary

 

[27]           During the month of December 2005, Mr. Deer was in communication with Mr. Karim. I make this finding based on the four entries respecting Mohamed, who I find is Mr. Karim, in Mr. Deer’s appointments on his computer, and Mr. Karim’s evidence he received a telephone call at the end of December from Mr. Deer asking him to come to Calgary for a few days. I find Mr. Karim did come to Calgary around December 28 or 29, 2005 and stayed at Mr. Deer’s home for a couple of nights.

 

[28]           The evidence respecting Mr. Karim coming to Calgary at the end of December, 2005 and January 15 and 16, 2006, and his observations and recollection of conversations between himself and Mr. Deer on both occasions, is found in Mr. Karim’s conversation with Cst. B. on April 23, 2006, Mr. Karim’s conversation with Det. C. on April 26, 2006, and Mr. Karim’s trial testimony.

 

[29]           The 2006 conversations were part of a Mr. Big operation that targeted Mr. Karim. These conversations are evidence against Mr. Karim, but not evidence against Mr. Deer.

 

[30]           There are differences between the two Mr. Big conversations and Mr. Karim’s trial testimony with respect to Mr. Karim’s account of events in Calgary at the end of December, 2005 and the events of January 15 and 16, 2006,.

 


[31]           I prefer Mr. Karim’s account of his December 2005 visit with Mr. Deer and the events of January 15 and 16, 2006 in the two Mr. Big conversations rather than his trial testimony. I make this finding for four reasons. First, the Mr. Big conversations took place approximately three months after the shooting of Mr. Beauchamp, when the events were more fresh in Mr. Karim’s mind than at his second trial, some six years after the shooting. Second, I have reviewed the transcript of Mr. Karim’s trial testimony on a number of occasions. Each time I reviewed it, I observed a another instance where Mr. Karim testified to a matter that was clearly based upon information he received after Mr. Beauchamp’s death and/or after he was charged with the murder of Mr. Beauchamp. While Mr. Karim’s conversations with Cst. B. and Det. C. have some references to information Mr. Karim appeared to have learned from media reports after Mr. Beauchamp’s death, this information is much more limited and easier to discern. Third, there is no evidence that any communication occurred between Mr. Deer and Mr. Karim after Mr. Deer dropped Mr. Karim at the Bus Depot on January 16, 2006 until some time after they were both arrested. This fact limits the possibility of any collusion between the two men. Fourth, Mr. Karim, in his conversations with both Cst. B. and Det. C., said he had “a plan” if the police arrested both he and Mr. Deer for the murder of Mr. Beauchamp. For example, he told Cst. B. his plan was: “... I would say, you know what? It was my friend, I was concerned about it, he knew nothing about it. I went behind his back and shot this guy.”

 

[32]           As I prefer the evidence of Mr. Karim’s conversation in the Mr. Big operations, I only accept those portions of his 2012 trial testimony that are consistent with the two Mr. Big conversations, unless otherwise stated. With this caveat, I make the following findings respecting Mr. Karim’s visit to Mr. Deer at the end of December 2005 based on Mr. Karim’s testimony.

 

[33]           Mr. Deer called Mr. Karim on approximately December 28, 2005 and asked him to come to Calgary; Mr. Karim agreed. Approximately the next day, Mr. Karim took the bus from Edmonton to Calgary and was picked up at the Greyhound Bus Depot by Mr. Deer. Mr. Karim stayed until the beginning of January in Calgary, approximately three nights of which were spent at Mr. Deer’s home.

 

[34]           During this visit, Mr. Deer told Mr. Karim about his business dealings with Morbank including Morbank’s approval of financing for his construction project, the retraction of the financing commitment by Morbank, Morbank’s position that Mr. Deer owed a commitment fee of approximately $16,000. to Morbank, Mr. Deer’s belief he did not owe any monies to Morbank, and that Morbank had set a deadline of December 31, 2005 or January 1, 2006 for the payment of the commitment fee monies.

 

[35]           Mr. Deer showed Mr. Karim the emails between himself and Mr. Beauchamp and told Mr. Karim about some of the telephone calls. Mr. Deer called Morbank employees and Mr. Beauchamp “gangsters” and “henchmen”. I observe these terms were used by Mr. Deer in his emails to Mr. Beauchamp.

 

[36]           I do not accept Mr. Karim’s testimony that Mr. Deer called Morbank and Mr. Beauchamp “Mafia”. I make this finding based on a review of the two Mr. Big conversations. In neither of the conversations did Mr. Karim use the word “Mafia” when discussing the events with either undercover officer. In particular, when Mr. Karim was asked by Cst. B. if the person he shot was “connected”, Mr. Karim replied “no”.

 

[37]           Mr. Karim observed Mr. Deer to be overly nervous and scared as a result of the emails and telephone calls. Therefore, the two men slept with glasses placed on the door handles of doors at night as a type of alarm system. In addition, Mr. Deer, at the request of Mr. Karim, gave Mr. Karim one of his handguns to keep with him at night for protection.

 

[38]           Mr. Karim believed the Morbank situation and Mr. Deer’s separation from his wife caused Mr. Deer a great deal of stress.

 

[39]           Mr. Karim, Mr. Deer and others including Mr. Logan, spent New Year’s Eve together at a pub. Mr. Karim stayed his remaining couple of nights in Calgary at the home of his former supervisor.

 


[40]           Mr. Karim returned to Edmonton on approximately January 2, 2006.

 

[41]           I note Mr. Karim’s evidence respecting New Year’s Eve is confirmed by the evidence of Mr. Logan.

 

[42]           I accept the evidence of Mr. Logan that on December 23, 2007 Mr. Deer showed him the emails between himself and Mr. Beauchamp that were on Mr. Deer’s computer. I accept Mr. Logan’s evidence that Mr. Deer described the emails and conversations with Mr. Beauchamp as threatening, and Mr. Deer appeared nervous for his business as a result of the emails.

 

January 15 and 16, 2006

 

[43]           A number of pieces of evidence establish a time line for January 15 and 16, 2006.

 

[44]           I accept Mr. Karim’s testimony that a day or so before January 15, he received another phone call from Mr. Deer to come to Calgary. I note Mr. Deer’s appointment on his computer entitled “Mohamed may come from Edmonton” was created on January 12, 2006 in the afternoon although the appointment start date reads January 15, 2006. I find Mr. Deer made this entry and it refers to Mr. Karim.

 

[45]           Mr. Karim agreed to come and arrived at the Greyhound Bus Depot in Calgary on January 15, 2006.

 

[46]           Mr. Karim’s bus ticket, which I infer was purchased in Edmonton, was found in Mr. Deer’s home during the execution of the search warrant. The date and time on the bus ticket is recorded as: 01/15/06 11:07 a.m.

 

[47]           The CCTV security cameras in the Bus Depot recorded Mr. Karim arriving, and some time later, Mr. Deer entering the bus depot. The two men were recorded leaving the bus depot.

 

[48]           Mr. Karim and Mr. Deer were next recorded on the CCTV security cameras of a London Drugs store, where the two men appeared to be shopping and some items were purchased.

 

[49]           A London Drugs receipt was seized from Mr. Deer’s motor vehicle during the execution of the search warrant. This receipt led the police to the London Drugs in question and the seizure of the CCTV security videos. The time recorded on the London Drugs receipt is 15:54 hours and the time recorded on the CCTV security videos is approximately the same time. I find 15:54 hours was the time Mr. Deer and Mr. Karim purchased the disposable gloves and rubbing alcohol at London Drugs. I accept Mr. Karim’s testimony the rubbing alcohol was purchased to clean the 22 caliber handgun he shot Mr. Beauchamp with.

 

[50]           I find from this fact that a plan had been made by Mr. Karim and Mr. Deer, prior to the purchase of these items, that Mr. Karim would confront Mr. Beauchamp at his office, while armed with a 22 caliber handgun.

 


[51]           Mr. Karim and Mr. Deer were recorded a third time on January 15, 2006 on CCTV security cameras, this time at a Walmart store where the two men were shopping. A Walmart receipt seized from Mr. Deer’s home during the execution of the search warrant led the police to the Walmart in question and the seizure of the CCTV security videos. The time on the receipt is 20:43:54 and the time recorded on the seized CCTV security videos is approximately the same time. I find Mr. Karim and Mr. Deer purchased sunglasses, men’s gloves and a nylon portfolio at 20:43:54 hours. I also accept Mr. Karim’s evidence that the sunglasses were purchased so Mr. Karim would not be recognized and the portfolio would allow him to look more like a businessman when he entered the office building at 635 - 8 Avenue S.W.

 

[52]           On Monday, January 16, 2006 Mr. Karim was recorded entering the building at 635 - 8 Avenue S.W. at 7:53 a.m. wearing the sunglasses and gloves, and carrying the briefcase purchased the night before. At 7:57 a.m. Mr. Karim was recorded leaving the office building, still wearing the sunglasses and gloves, and carrying the briefcase.

 

[53]           I accept Mr. Karim’s evidence that upon leaving the office building, he went to where Mr. Deer was parked in his vehicle. The two men drove to Mr. Deer’s house where Mr. Karim shaved off his beard and changed his clothes. The two men drove to an area where the gun and Mr. Karim’s clothes were discarded, and then drove to the Bus Depot. En route to the Bus Depot, Mr. Deer stopped at a bank machine and withdrew monies, most of which he gave to Mr. Karim. A TD Bank withdrawal receipt was found in Mr. Deer’s possession on his arrest and records the time of withdrawal at 09:52 hours.

 

[54]           CCTV security cameras recorded Mr. Deer and Mr. Karim entering the Bus Depot together and after a period of time, Mr. Deer departed. Mr. Deer was arrested at his home at 11:20 a.m. that same morning.
