I substitute the verdicts of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for the lesser and included offenses of manslaughter of Lyle and Marie McCann near Peers, Alberta, on or about July 3, 2010. On October 31st, I entered convictions based on these verdicts for manslaughter and those convictions are confirmed.
