[5]           The complainant and the accused have some memory of an incident that occurred at the accused's home. They both say that on a school day the complainant stayed home from school while his parents were both at work. Then the accused with his car took the complainant to a Wendy's (they disagree on which Wendy's) restaurant to get a take-out lunch of sandwiches and soda pop. The accused and the complainant then took the lunch to the accused's home, an apartment he shared with a room mate. That apartment was on the second floor of a building and could be accessed by a front staircase and a back staircase.



[6]           Before long they were both having their lunch while sitting on the accused's bed in his bedroom. The accused says that he had tried turning on a TV in the living room but when he saw that it was connected to his room mate's video game system, he took the complainant into his bedroom to watch a movie on the TV there. On June 21, 2017 the accused could not remember which movie. He now thinks they watched a war movie, maybe Schindler's List.



[7]           The complainant says they went directly to the accused's bedroom and that the accused played gay porn on the TV while they sat on the bed and had their lunch. The complainant thinks the accused put a drug in his pop but does not say that he saw that happen. He might have heard it. He says he lost consciousness and came-to naked, with his hands tied and with the accused partly undressed and masturbating, then performing oral sex on him and then on top of him. Then they heard a noise, possibly the roommate or the roommate's dog, and left by the back stairs.



[8]           The accused denies all of that and notes that at one time the complainant said that the accused carried him down the stairs and on another occasion that they walked. At trial the complainant added the detail that he heard the accused "crunch" what may have been a pill before handing the complainant his pop. The accused says they left his apartment because the complainant had to get home before his mother got there.



[9]           The accused told the police on June 21, 2017:

"... we watched a movie and things just happened. I, I really I thought he was 16 years-old I really did....   ... we just started fooling around.... Like kissing and.  ... I believe we kissed and you know touched and stuff like not touched each other's penises but just fooling around just by kissing. And he said I'm not gay and then we stopped. ... I didn't tie him up or anything .... we were watching TV lying in bed um cause that's where my TV was. You know I didn't have other TV except in my room and uh we kissed and that was it. That's all I can remember I, I never performed oral sex on him. I'm telling you what happened we kissed and he said listen I'm not gay and that was it. I did not masturbate in front of him. My God that's all I can do is look you in the eye and say that to ya that's if you believe me but I didn't do it.... Uh I do care about [the complainant]  absolutely and uh you know uh the only thing I'm sorry for is if I hurt, if he feels that I hurt him in any way, but I didn't do the things he's saying that I did.  ... I consider him a good friend. um I thought he was gay, I really did. I thought he's you know interested and I thought he's of age and that's, and if you're telling me he wasn't of age, then I will apologize but I really thought he was." (Ex. C-6)



[10]         At trial the accused says the complainant initiated the day's events by calling the accused, asking him to take him out to get something to eat and asking if they could hang out. The accused says that when they got their food the complainant asked if he could drive the car but admitted that he did not have a driver's permit. The accused says they talked about an upcoming hockey tournament in December and the complainant wanted to pick the games he would referee.



[11]         Also at trial the accused added to his description of the activity on the bed.  He says that they "started play fighting and tickling" and "we did kiss" until the complainant said "I'm not gay".  The accused says the complainant must have misunderstood what happened. The accused also says that the complainant has tended to exaggerate or embellish events in the past as well as Game Incident Reports he wrote as a referee.
