The Facts



[6]                                       As is true in all cases, the trial judge's findings of fact and credibility are central to the application of the relevant principles. On the evening in question, the police received a call from an irate motorist who had been cut off by another vehicle. Armed with a description of that vehicle and its general location, the police were able to locate the appellant's truck within twenty minutes. It was parked in the parking lot of a local bar. The police officer parked his vehicle some 150 to 200 feet from the appellant's vehicle, ostensibly for the purpose of completing some paperwork. A few minutes later, the police officer heard the appellant's truck being started. The vehicle's lights were on and the appellant was behind the wheel. Within seconds, the appellant turned the ignition and lights off, got out of the vehicle and headed back towards the bar entrance. At this point, the police officer got out of his vehicle and requested the appellant to stop. The appellant complied with the demand and, shortly thereafter, he was arrested for the offence that is the subject matter of this appeal, namely having “care or control” of his vehicle, at a time when his blood-alcohol level exceeded the statutory limit, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.



[7]                                       The trial judge accepted the appellant's testimony as to the circumstances leading up to his arrest. The appellant testified that, on first entering the bar, he had arranged with the bartender to take him home that evening. The appellant also testified that, while in the bar, another patron had advised him that his truck's taillights were on. The appellant testified that the switch to the vehicle's lights had been malfunctioning such that the lights remained on even after the switch was turned off. In response to the information received from the other bar patron, the appellant went out to his vehicle, got in and started the motor for two purposes: to see whether the battery was dead and whether the lights would go out. As soon as the engine turned over, the appellant flicked the light switch and the lights went off. As described earlier, the appellant then turned off the ignition, got out of the vehicle and headed back to the bar. The trial judge found that the appellant was in his vehicle for only a "brief moment" and that all of the pertinent events took place within a "minute or two." The trial judge accepted the appellant's evidence in its entirety, including the contention that the appellant had arranged for the bartender to drive him and his truck home. The fact that the bartender did not testify did not impact on the trial judge's assessment of the appellant's credibility.



[8]                                       There is one factual aspect of this case that I consider to be of critical significance. No one has suggested or argued that the appellant was aware of the police officer’s presence in the parking lot, either before he climbed into his truck to turn off the lights and to see whether the battery was dead or as he was leaving it. Thus, we must jettison from our factual matrix the notion that the appellant fled the vehicle for the purpose of evading a charge under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. If the findings of fact had been that the accused got out of the vehicle as soon as he realized that the police were watching, the trial judge may well have come to a different conclusion with respect to both the appellant's credibility and the statutory presumption. On those facts, the trial judge may have held that the appellant occupied the driver's seat for the purpose of putting the vehicle in motion. Nevertheless, the law constantly reminds us to decide cases in accordance with the trial judge's findings.

The Decisions & Error Below



[9]                                       The appellant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. Succinctly stated, that subsection provides that it is an offence to have care or control of a motor vehicle, whether or not it is in motion, when one’s blood-alcohol level exceeds the statutory limit. Throughout, it has been common ground that the appellant's blood-alcohol level exceeded the statutory limit. As to the other elements of the offence, the trial judge made two key findings. First, he held that the appellant had successfully rebutted the presumption of care or control set out in s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Once the Crown proves, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused occupied the driver's seat, this presumption applies unless the accused establishes that he or she did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. The trial judge ruled that the appellant had no such intention and the respondent Crown has never challenged this finding. However, the legal analysis cannot stop here as an intention to put a vehicle in motion is not an essential element of the offence. The Crown is entitled to establish “actual” care or control. At this point, the law is no longer concerned with the accused’s intent but rather with whether the accused’s interaction with the vehicle qualifies as “care or control” as that term is understood in the jurisprudence. In that regard, the trial judge formulated the correlative issue in terms of whether the appellant's interaction with his vehicle posed a “risk of danger to the public” and answered the question in the negative. The trial judge's analysis relies heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in R. v. Toews, 1985 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119, [1985] S.C.J. No. 48 (QL) and on the decision rendered by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in R. v. Hannemann, 2001 CanLII 28423 (ON SC), [2001] O.J. No. 1686 (Sup.Ct.)(QL). The latter case involved an accused who had been found “sleeping it off” in the front seat of his car with the motor running. He too was acquitted of the offence. I should point out that the reasons of Justice Hill in Hannemann offer the most comprehensive analysis of the jurisprudence to date in this area of the law.



[10]                                   In the case at bar, the summary conviction appeal court judge set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge had misapplied the law. The appeal court judge understood the trial judge's reasons to stand for the proposition that if there is “no intention to drive” there can be no “risk to public safety”. Based on that interpretation of the trial judge’s reasons, the appeal court judge summarily allowed the Crown’s appeal. Had the trial judge acquitted the appellant on the basis articulated by the appeal court judge, the latter’s decision would have been unassailable. But with great respect, the appellant was not acquitted on the basis. The trial judge adopted and applied what he understood to be the analytical framework set out in Toews and Hannemann. The latter case is of importance because it unequivocally contradicts the Crown’s contention that risk of danger is not an essential element of the care or control offence in cases where the accused is found in the vehicle with the motor running. Admittedly, the references to Hannemann are problematic in one respect: the risk analysis focuses on arguments and counterarguments unique to that category of case (the sleeping-it-off cases). That said, the trial judge reasoned that the facts of the present case and those in Hannemann bear too close a resemblance to discount. In each case, the accused had a blood-alcohol level that exceeded the statutory limit and each was found sitting behind the wheel with the motor running. One factual difference is that the appellant was awake when observed by the police. In Hannemann the accused was found asleep behind the wheel. The distinction has no bearing on the outcome of this case.
