II. Facts

 


[2]               The Crown alleges that Steinke killed Marc, Debra and Jacob Richardson  in their Medicine Hat home, sometime between April 22 and 23, 2006. His co-accused, a young offender, was also charged with three counts of first degree murder. At the time of the offence, Steinke and his co-accused were dating; he was 23 years old, she was 12. Two other individuals have been charged in relation to the murder. Kacy Lancaster, 20, is charged with being an accessory to murder. She is still awaiting trial. A 17-year-old young offender was also charged with being an accessory to murder, but pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of obstruction of justice on June 19, 2007 and received 20 months of probation.

 

[3]                The young offender co-accused was tried by a Justice of this court, sitting with a jury in June and July of 2007. On July 9, 2007, she was convicted of three counts of first degree murder. On November 8, 2007 the Court imposed a ten-year intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order pursuant to section 42(2)(q) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002 c.1.

 

[4]               At the young offender’s jury trial it was the theory of the Crown that Steinke had stabbed Marc and Debra Richardson to death and killed Jacob Richardson by slitting his throat and stabbing him. According to the Crown, the young offender aided or abetted Steinke, or counselled him to commit the murder of her family. The defence theory was that the young offender was a victim of the relationship she had with the older Steinke who acted alone in carrying out the murders. The defence theory was rejected and, as stated, the young offender was convicted of three counts of first degree murder.

 

[5]               These crimes attracted and continue to attract significant publicity. There was wide reporting in the local, provincial and national print and electronic media. The Defence has provided me with articles from the Medicine Hat News dating from April 26, 2006 to December 5, 2007 in which Steinke was referenced by name. During the young offender’s trial and Steinke’s preliminary inquiry there have been hundreds of media reports. The Medicine Hat News published many articles and commentaries. I counted 28 articles that referenced Steinke directly. Some of these articles gave a very detailed account of the evidence presented at the young offender’s trial. In the city of Medicine Hat, with a population of around 57,000, the Medicine Hat News has a daily circulation in February of 2008 of 12,150 copies. Other media present at the young offender’s trial were the Globe and Mail, Canadian Press, CTV, CBC and City TV, as well as local and regional media from Lethbridge and Calgary.
