E.                 Deterrence under s 718(b)
[74]           As a sentencing objective, deterrence has two facets. Individual deterrence is aimed at deterring the offender from committing such a crime, or any crime, in the future. General deterrence is aimed at the community at large, informing others of the negative consequences arising from such criminal behaviour.

[75]           Lengthened periods of parole ineligibility may reasonably be expected to deter some persons from reoffending:  Shropshire at para 21. In Shropshire, parole was delayed by only two years beyond the minimum 10 years for second degree murder. The reasonable expectation that a lengthened period will deter a person from reoffending logically diminishes in proportion to the length of the mandatory period of parole ineligibility. This is because a delay in parole eligibility by 25 years already has a much more significant deterrent effect than a 10 year minimum delay.

[76]           Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank will receive sentences of imprisonment for life. Even if eligible to apply for parole at some point during their lives, neither one is guaranteed to obtain parole. It is difficult to imagine how an additional 25 or 50 years of parole ineligibility will do more to impress upon them the fact that they should not commit crimes in the future. The objective of individual deterrence, to the extent that it can be satisfied, will be fulfilled through imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. Even if parole is granted at some point, the strict control of the parole system itself serves the sentencing goal of specific deterrence. I am not satisfied that a period of parole ineligibility longer than 25 years would provide greater individual deterrence for these offenders.

[77]           Ironically, imposing 25 years of parole ineligibility may do more to effectively deter Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank from committing crimes while incarcerated than would imposition of 50 or 75 years of parole ineligibility. Individuals who have no hope of ever achieving release arguably have much less deterrent to committing further crimes while incarcerated. The prospect of potential release may therefore serve to protect inmates, corrections officers and anyone else who may come into contact with the offender, from potential harm. Further, a prospect of freedom may encourage an inmate to attempt to improve his prospects for parole through treatment and programs provided in the corrections environment.

[78]           In other words, life sentences imposed on these offenders with no parole eligibility for 25 years will require them to conduct themselves in an exemplary manner and to successfully complete all recommended and available treatments so as to convince the Parole Board, at the appropriate time, that their imprisonment is no longer required to protect society:  Ramsurrun at para 110.

[79]           As for general deterrence, any fixed period of parole ineligibility reflects Parliament’s view that a minimum period of physical confinement is necessary to advance the causes of deterrence and denunciation even if the offender was completely rehabilitated and posed absolutely no threat to society at the time of sentence:  CAM at para 64.

[80]           However, there is nothing before the Court to establish or even suggest that an increase in parole ineligibility beyond 25 years might play any real role in deterring members of the public from committing more than one murder, nor is it reasonable to draw such an inference. I would go so far as to suggest that it would be folly to think that a person pondering more than one first degree murder would be deterred from committing a second or third murder by the possibility of consecutive parole ineligibility periods.

[81]           In my view, a life sentence achieves the objective of general deterrence in these cases. I am not satisfied that increased parole ineligibility assists in achieving the objectives of individual or general deterrence.

F.                  Separation from Society where Necessary under s 718(c)
[82]           As I have already noted, s 745.51 was intended, in part, to help ensure that our communities are safe and that those multiple murderers who should never be released, will never be released. Section s 718(c) mandates that separation from society is based on necessity.

[83]           Consequently, the ability to set parole ineligibility consecutively at 50 or 75 years is a form of punishment particularly appropriate for first degree murderers who are, and will be, dangerous to society. It is an appropriate measure for those not personally deterred by the prospect of at least 25 years of incarceration and who will be incapable of rehabilitation.

[84]           In Shropshire, the Supreme Court held that “future dangerousness” falls within the analysis of the “character of the offender”.

[85]           I have already noted that neither offender in this case has a prior criminal record. Although there is evidence before the Court that each one was involved in some forms of anti-social behaviour prior to the commission of the murders, none of that behaviour would be considered a reliable indicator that either one of these individuals could or would be involved in a violent crime, much less three first degree murders.

[86]           The difficulty for a court in determining whether separation from society will be necessary for a period in excess of 25 years is that it is impossible to know what the impact of at least 25 years of incarceration will have on these individual offenders, based solely on the offences and the offenders’ backgrounds to the time of sentencing. This necessarily requires a prediction of the future based on very little or no relevant and material foundational evidence.

[87]           Simply put, there is no evidence in this case upon which this Court can conclude that Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank will pose a danger to the community in 25 years so as to necessitate continued separation from society. It is difficult, if not impossible, to individualize the sentence and specifically the appropriate period of parole ineligibility, with no evidence as to how these particular offenders will respond to the sanctions that are imposed and the opportunities afforded for their rehabilitation.

[88]           By contrast, prior to finding an offender to be a "dangerous offender" under s 753 of the Criminal Code, there must be evidence establishing that the offender is very dangerous and incapable of control in the community. On a court making such a finding, the offender receives a sentence of indeterminate detention but may still apply under s 761 for parole after 7 years and then every 2 years thereafter. In determining whether an offender should be granted parole, and if so on what conditions, the Parole Board reviews the condition, history and circumstances of the offender.

[89]           Again, if Mr. Klaus or Mr. Frank were to be eligible to apply for parole after 25 years, there is no guarantee that either one would receive parole. Each one would be required, at that time, to satisfy the Parole Board that he could be released into the community on such conditions as are necessary to ensure the continued safety of the community.

[90]           I conclude that the objective of separation from society where necessary is adequately addressed for each of these offenders by the penalty of life in prison without eligibility for parole for 25 years.

G.               Rehabilitation under s 718(d)
[91]           Rehabilitation is one of the main objectives of Canadian sentencing law, and is one of the fundamental moral values distinguishing Canadian society from the societies of many other nations in the world:  R v Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 at para 4, [2015] 3 SCR 1089. In sentencing for murder, rehabilitation is secondary to other principles, such as deterrence and denunciation. Nevertheless, it remains a relevant consideration.

[92]           I have found for these offenders that the principles of denunciation and deterrence are met by a sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. I must also consider the principle of rehabilitation along with other secondary principles and objectives enumerated in the Criminal Code.

[93]           As I discussed in relation to the principle of individual deterrence, there is social utility in allowing offenders to remain hopeful that they eventually will be released. A prisoner facing a period of parole ineligibility until very near or past his life expectancy will be left bereft of hope. A life wanting of hope can only leave one questioning the value of attempts at rehabilitation. Hope of eventual release logically encourages an individual to strive for rehabilitation.

[94]           The Report of a Committee Appointed to Inquire into the Principles and Procedures Followed in the Remission Service of the Department of Justice of Canada (Ottawa: Department of Justice, 1956) [the “Fauteux Report”] looked at the entire corrections system in Canada and recommended at 48-49:

At no time should any prisoner have reason to feel that he is a forgotten man.... Prisoners should have some hope that imprisonment will end and thereby have some incentive for reformation and rehabilitation.

[95]           I do not believe that other “exceptional remedies” such as the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, as discussed by the Court in R v Granados-Arana, 2017 ONSC 6785, [2017] OJ No 5964, truly provide offenders with a reasonable hope of eventual release.

[96]           In most criminal cases, once a sentence is imposed it falls to the Parole Board to further determine the date and conditions of parole eligibility. As noted, the CCRA now puts more emphasis than it previously did on the protection of the public and less on pure rehabilitation objectives and concerns. The decision-making process of the Parole Board under the CCRA is largely based on the ongoing observation and assessment of the personality and behaviour of the offender during incarceration to determine dangerousness and the offender's ability to re-enter the community:  Zinck at para 19.

[97]           There was no evidence put forward that would support a finding that either Mr. Klaus or Mr. Frank is incapable of rehabilitation and therefore will be dangerous in 25 years.

[98]           The Parole Board would be in a much better position at that time to determine whether the public requires continued protection from Mr. Klaus or Mr. Frank.

H.               Reparations for Harm Done under s 718(e)
[99]           As discussed earlier, the Court heard seven Victim Impact Statements highlighting the devastating effects and grievous harm caused by the actions of Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank.

[100]      It may be some small comfort for the community to know that public policy prevents these offenders from benefitting financially from the murders of the Klaus family members.

[101]      Nevertheless, it must be recognized that there is no aspect of any sentence for first degree murder that can begin to provide adequate reparation to the victims or the community for the harm done.

I.                  Promoting Acceptance of Responsibility and Acknowledgement of the Harm Done to Victims and the Community under s 718(f)
[102]      A life sentence is the most severe sentence in Canadian law and as such reflects the severity of the harm done to the victims and the community. To date, neither offender in this case has adequately acknowledged the harm done as a result of his involvement in these murders. Each one tried to absolve himself by blaming the other.

[103]      The question for the Court is whether consecutive parole ineligibility periods would do more to promote their remorse or acceptance of responsibility than would a minimum of 25 years. Each one will necessarily be incarcerated during what they would otherwise have reasonably hoped to have been some of the best 25 years of their lives. There is no basis for me to conclude that these offenders would be more remorseful or accepting of responsibility as a result of delaying parole ineligibility for a period longer than 25 years.

J.                  Totality under s 718.2(c) and Restraint under s 718.2(d)
[104]      In the usual course, a court considering whether to make sentences concurrent or consecutive will have regard to the totality principle. This requires the court to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender:  Clayton C Ruby, Sentencing, 9th ed (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2017) at 54.

[105]      Statutory totality requires consideration of whether a cumulative sentence will crush the offender's rehabilitative prospects. It requires a sentencing court to engage in an individualized consideration of restraint which exists over and above whether a cumulative sentence for the offences is broadly proportionate:  R v Brodt, 2016 ABCA 373 at para 6, [2016] AJ No 1237.

[106]      The principle of restraint requires a court not to deprive an offender of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances. The principle of restraint applies, for example, in determining whether less restrictive sanctions are available under the dangerous offender provisions. A sentencing judge is only to impose an indeterminate sentence when there are no other less restrictive means to adequately protect the public from the threat of harm:  R v Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 at paras 28-29, [2003] 2 SCR 357.

[107]      As stated earlier, retribution incorporates the principle of restraint. Sentencing judges are to exercise restraint by refraining from imposing a sentence which so greatly exceeds an offender's expected remaining life span that the traditional goals of sentencing, even general deterrence and denunciation, have all but depleted their functional value:  CAM at para 74. Where the potential exists for the loss of freedom for even a day, we, as a free and democratic society, must place the highest emphasis on ensuring that our system of justice minimizes the chances of an unwarranted denial of liberty:  R v Hall, 2002 SCC 64 at para 47, [2002] 3 SCR 309.

[108]      Hope for eventual release, although not set out as a principle in the Criminal Code, is a relevant factor in sentencing. It is “one of the conditions that inflects the nature of a sentence. It gives flavour, character and existential texture to the experience of punishment ...”:  Benjamin Berger, "Sentencing and the Salience of Pain and Hope" (2015) 70 Sup Ct L Rev 337 at 355. Setting parole ineligibility at 50 or 75 years constitutes a harsh intervention in an offender’s life. Sentencing judges must “be alive to the way that a sentence is lived and, specifically, to the harshness involved in the extinguishment of hope”: Berger at 356.

[109]      Where a discretion in sentencing exists, the court should not lose sight of any of the relevant sentencing principles. The court must ensure that the sentence accords with the principles of proportionality, totality and restraint.

[110]      A denunciatory sentence is necessarily symbolic:  CAM at para 81. However, it must also be recognized that symbolism in and of itself is not a sentencing objective or principle in the Criminal Code. Sentences that exceed a person’s foreseeable life serve no functional purpose; they are purely symbolic. When a sentence exceeds a reasonable estimate of an offender’s remaining natural life span, “the utilitarian and normative goals of sentencing will eventually begin to exhaust themselves”:  CAM at para 74.

[111]      A sentence that extinguishes any hope of release for an offender is a crushing sentence. It risks violating the principle of totality as being unduly long and especially harsh. A sentence for first degree murder may inevitably have that effect for an older offender. As well, in extremely egregious cases, offenders may deserve to have all hope extinguished. In cases involving unique, exceptional and extremely egregious facts, such as the rape and murder of 11 children or the killing of 6 and potentially close to 50 vulnerable women, the maximum parole ineligibility period might be imposed without necessarily offending the totality principle. I need not consider that at this time. This is not one of those cases.

[112]      As emphasized in Zinck at paras 30-31, delayed parole is a special, additional and harsher form of punishment. Stacking periods of parole ineligibility under s. 745.51, just as the Court stated with respect to delayed parole under s. 743.6, should be neither routine, nor automatic. It must remain the exception and be justified by the circumstances of a particular case.

[113]      Again, it is impossible to foresee in this case whether less restrictive sanctions could ultimately be appropriate for one or both of these offenders. The Parole Board may well determine in 25 years that no less restrictive sanctions short of the continued imprisonment of Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank could ensure the safety of the public. However, in that case it could be said with greater certainty that the principle of restraint had been properly considered and applied.

[114]      Here, the minimum sentence of 25 years of parole ineligibility is the least restrictive sentence that can be imposed. For both Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank, given their ages at the time of the offences (38 and 28), parole ineligibility of 50 or 75 years would virtually guarantee that these offenders would spend the remainder of their productive lives in prison. The functional value of the traditional goals of sentencing would have been depleted. Given all of the sentencing factors and their application in these circumstances, such an outcome would be unduly long and harsh. It would violate the principles of totality and restraint.

VI.              Conclusion
[115]      Section 745.51 is not a mandatory provision, even in the case of multiple first degree murders. This Court has the discretion to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility where warranted having regard to all of the relevant factors. Having considered all of the relevant factors under s 745.51 and the principles and objectives of sentencing, I conclude that a period of parole ineligibility of 50 or 75 years is neither justifiable nor appropriate for either offender in this case.

VII.           Applicability of s 745.51 to Contemporaneous Multiple Murders
[116]      Mr. Frank has also argued that s 745.51 does not apply here given the plain wording of the section. He argues that this provision only applies to an offender who has already been convicted of murder on a prior occasion.

[117]      I have undertaken the requisite analysis assuming that s 745.51 does apply in these circumstances. In light of my conclusions, it is unnecessary to consider this issue of interpretation raised by counsel.

VIII.        Final Comments
[118]      It will be apparent from the foregoing reasons that I do not view s 745.51 as a particularly effective means of addressing Parliament’s concerns, especially with respect to those offenders who are convicted of first degree murders where the only options before the Court involve increments of 25 years. Indeed, the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods under s 745.51 may necessarily conflict with some of the principles and objectives of sentencing set out in ss 718 to 718.2 which have long been part of our sentencing regime.

[119]      I come to this conclusion having regard to fundamental principles of sentencing.

[120]      As for denunciation, Parliament apparently intended through s 745.51 to address a perceived “discount” for offenders convicted of multiple murders. It bears noting, however, that prior to 2011, multiple murderers were in fact not treated in the same way as single victim murderers. The “faint hope” clause in the Criminal Code allowed single victim murderers to seek early release on parole after serving only 15 years of their sentence:  s 745.6. That provision did not apply to multiple murderers and prevented them from receiving such consideration: s 745.6(2). This provision was amended and “faint hope” consideration is now only available for offenders who committed the relevant offence before December 2, 2011:  s 745.6(1)(a.1).

[121]      Furthermore, far from assuaging the public’s concerns regarding “discounts”, there is a danger that s 745.51 will actually undermine the public’s confidence in sentencing in cases of multiple murders. The penalty for first degree murder has always been, and continues to be, the most severe mandatory sentence available in Canadian criminal law. Where a court now declines on a principled basis to extend parole ineligibility for a multiple murderer under s 745.51, it might wrongly appear to victims’ families and members of the public that the lives of one or more victims have been discounted in the process. In fact, that is not the case at all, as the number of victims is just one of numerous circumstances and factors which a court must consider in exercising its discretion.

[122]      As outlined above, the goals of denunciation and individual deterrence are generally met by a sentence of life imprisonment combined with the strict controls of the parole system in the event that the offender is granted parole after 25 years. It is important to recognize that a sentence of life imprisonment necessarily involves control by the state for the rest of the offender’s life.

[123]      As for general deterrence, I am skeptical as to whether increased parole ineligibility for multiple murderers has any useful deterrent effect. I am prepared to assume that a member of the public probably understands that he may well spend his remaining lifetime in prison if he commits murder. However, it seems far-fetched to opine that a person, having formed the intention to murder more than one individual, would weigh in the balance the combinations and permutations under s 745.51, and would stop offending after the first murder as a consequence of possible variations in parole eligibility ensuing from a second or third murder.

[124]      Regarding separation from society and rehabilitation, when a court imposes consecutive periods of parole ineligibility for multiple murders, it assumes the role which the Parole Board would have played many years into the future, and does this based on facts and factors existing only prior to and at the time of sentencing. While it has been opined that permitting trial judges to extend the period of parole ineligibility may not usurp or impinge upon the function of the Parole Board, delaying parole eligibility does remove the broad discretion Parliament has otherwise conferred on the Parole Board:  Shropshire at para 34, R v Lam, 2007 ABCA 83 at para 3, [2007] AJ No 252. The stacking of lengthy periods of parole ineligibility under s 745.51 impacts significantly on the traditional roles of the sentencing judge and of the Parole Board. It must be kept in mind that the Parole Board operates in a highly regulated environment and remains ultimately subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts.

[125]      As I have noted, the Parole Board determines the date and conditions of parole eligibility and is required to consider the protection of the public. In the case of these two offenders, the Parole Board will have the benefit of information on the personality and behaviour of each offender during 25 years of incarceration, and thus will be in a far better position to determine dangerousness and the offender's ability to re-enter the community in 25 years. In exercising discretion under s 745.51, a sentencing court is necessarily deprived of the opportunity to consider those facts and opinions that might later be available at the time of parole eligibility in order to make an informed determination as to whether continued incarceration at that time is necessary for the continued protection of the public. It is difficult to understand the logic in advancing – in a case such as this one, by 25 years - the consideration of an offender’s future trajectory, thereby requiring a sentencing court to engage in the realm of speculation.

[126]      The fact that sentencing remains a highly individualized process requires the Court to consider the potential effect of the sanction imposed, and the success of rehabilitative efforts, on the individual offenders before it. In some cases, a court may have expert evidence of dangerousness which supports imposition of an extended parole ineligibility period into the foreseeable future:  R v Cheddesingh, 2004 SCC 16 at para 2, [2004] 1 SCR 433. On the sentencing of a first degree murderer, a court rarely has before it sufficient evidence to enable it to determine whether an offender will be dangerous in 25 years. It would likely be very difficult for the Crown to adduce such evidence in all but the most extreme cases. The Parole Board of Canada has traditionally been the body best equipped to make that determination based in large measure on the offender’s history during incarceration.

[127]      There is nothing before the Court to suggest that the Parole Board regime did not adequately address the goal of separation from society in the case of multiple murderers. Parliament could have achieved all of its stated objectives through amendments to the CCRA, for example through less frequent potential parole applications by those who are convicted of having committed the most serious of crimes. This would also achieve the aim of relieving an undue burden on victims’ families by regular attendances at parole hearings. Further, it is not clear why Parliament felt it necessary to restrict the options before the court to stacking murder parole ineligibility periods, as opposed to allowing for discretionary increases of a lesser magnitude.

[128]      Finally, statutory totality requires consideration of whether a cumulative sentence will crush the offender's rehabilitative prospects, and the principle of restraint requires a court not to deprive an offender of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances. Successful rehabilitation may support the imposition of less restrictive sanctions that would still ensure individual deterrence and the continued protection of the public.

[129]      I have commented on the role that hope plays in relation to these sentencing principles and objectives. Hope for eventual release also respects the dignity of the prisoner: Derek Spencer, “Hope for Murderers? International Guidance on Interpreting the Protecting Canadians by Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act” (2017) 22 Can Crim L Rev 207 at 227, 232.

[130]      Although there are differing international approaches to the issue of lifelong incarceration, many of the international perspectives support the view that hope of release is a critical component.

[131]      In 1977, the German Federal Constitution Court held that the “essence of human dignity is attacked if the prisoner, notwithstanding his personal development, must abandon any hope of regaining his freedom”:  cited in Dirk van Zyl Smit, “Life imprisonment: Recent issues in national and international law” (2006) 29 Int'l JL & Psychiatry 405 at 409. The German Court accepted that the principle of human dignity is compromised if the offender must abandon all hope of ever being released, even if that hope is never realized due to continued dangerousness:  van Zyl Smit (2006) at 409.

[132]      More recently, in Vinter and Others v United Kingdom, [2013] ECHR 645 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights provided a summary of the use of life sentences in 47 countries. The Court noted that in nine of those countries, no life imprisonment exists and that 32 countries provide a dedicated mechanism for reviewing the sentence after the prisoner has served a certain minimum period fixed by law:  Vinter at para 68. The Court concluded that there is clear support in European and international law for the principle that all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, be offered the possibility of rehabilitation and the prospect of release if that rehabilitation is achieved:  Vinter at para 114. Power-Forde J. commented:

The judgment recognises, implicitly, that hope is an important and constitutive aspect of the human person. Those who commit the most abhorrent and egregious of acts and who inflict untold suffering upon others nevertheless retain their fundamental humanity and carry within themselves the capacity to change. Long and deserved though their prison sentences may be, they retain the right to hope that, someday, they may have atoned for the wrongs which they have committed. They ought not to be deprived entirely of such hope. To deny them the experience of hope would be to deny a fundamental aspect of their humanity and, to do that, would be degrading.

[133]      The Court made it clear that offenders who continued to pose a risk to society could be detained in prison until the end of their lives. In the absence of a real prospect of release, however, the denial of any hope of release would be inhumane and degrading. All offenders, no matter what they have done, should have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves while maintaining the prospect of reintegrating into free society:  Dirk van Zyl Smit et al, “Whole Life Sentences and the Tide of European Human Rights Jurisprudence:  What Is to Be Done?” 2014 HRL Rev 59 at 62, 65. The Court also explained that “it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether ... a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release”: Vinter at para 122.

[134]      Other courts have reached similar conclusions. Clearly, many international jurisdictions have recognized the importance of, and have protected, the right of an offender to retain some hope for possible release in the event of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is more likely when there is a hope of possible release. For most offenders, parole ineligibility periods of 50 years extinguish that hope, and periods of 75 years certainly do so even for the youngest offender, thereby severely undermining prospects of rehabilitation. Although a secondary consideration in murder cases, rehabilitation remains one of the main objectives of Canadian sentencing law. It has been held to be one of the fundamental moral values distinguishing Canadian society from the societies of many other nations:  Lacasse. One might argue that this distinction is eroded by the imposition of consecutive ineligibility periods under s 745.51.
