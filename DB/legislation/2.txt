The Supreme Court Jurisprudence



[11]                                   Accepting that the summary conviction appeal court judge erred by misapprehending the ratio of the trial judge’s reasons for acquittal, it falls on this Court to decide whether the trial judge erred by requiring the Crown to establish that the appellant’s interaction with his vehicle created a risk of danger. As noted at the outset, the Crown submits that the law does not require the Court to pursue a risk inquiry so long as the evidence establishes a sufficient interaction between the accused and the vehicle’s “fittings or equipment”. The Crown contends that a finding of guilt is virtually axiomatic once the accused is observed starting the vehicle’s motor while impaired or with a blood-alcohol level exceeding the statutory limit. The question is whether the Supreme Court jurisprudence supports the Crown’s understanding of the law or the appellant’s contention that danger is an essential element of the offence.



[12]                                   By way of background, it was in 1925 that Parliament first made it an offence for a person who was "intoxicated" to have "care or control" of a motor vehicle. It was not until 1947 that the Criminal Code was amended to provide for a rebuttable presumption in favour of the Crown, which is now found in s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The presumption’s present wording is the result of a 1985 revision and, succinctly stated, it provides that once the Crown proves that the accused occupied the driver's seat, the accused is deemed to have had care or control of that vehicle unless the accused establishes that he or she did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. Putting aside legal issues surrounding the concept of “impairment”, since 1925 the Supreme Court has published only seven decisions that dwell on the essential elements of the offence. Four of the decisions establish general principles that are not in issue on this appeal. In R. v. Appleby, 1971 CanLII 4 (SCC), [1972] S.C.R. 303, [1971] S.C.J. No. 112 (QL), in which the Supreme Court held that in order to rebut the presumption of care or control under what is now s. 258(1)(a), the accused must establish on a “balance of probabilities” that he or she did not have the intention to drive. The standard of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” was rejected. R. v. Proudlock, 1978 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525, [1978] S.C.J. No. 100 (QL), deals with the wording of the statutory presumption prior to its amendment in 1985. The third decision is R. v. Whyte, 1988 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, [1988] S.C.J. No. 63 (QL). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the rebuttable presumption found in s. 258(1)(a) does not violate the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the Charter. The fourth case is R. v. Penno, 1990 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865, [1990] S.C.J. No. 96 (QL), in which it was held that intoxication is not a defence to a charge under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. Both Penno and Whyte do have an impact on the question whether danger is an essential element of the offence.



[13]                                   We are left with three Supreme Court decisions pertinent to this appeal. The first in time is cited less frequently in the jurisprudence: R. v. Saunders, 1967 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1967] S.C.R. 284, [1967] S.C.J. No. 21 (QL). The other two decisions are consistently cited and discussed in virtually every “care or control” case: R. v. Ford, 1982 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 231, [1982] S.C.J. No. 4 (QL) and R. v. Toews. I must point out that all three decisions are remarkable for their brevity and in two instances it is necessary to turn to the underlying decision of the court of appeal to appreciate what was being argued and decided in the Supreme Court. As well, one must recognize from the outset that none of the decisions deals head-on with the issue of whether danger is an essential element of the offence. The analysis requires that inferences be drawn from facts and isolated statements of the law. I shall deal with the cases chronologically and then refer briefly to an-oft cited passage from Penno and one from Whyte.



[14]                                   In Saunders, the Court was asked to decide whether an “inoperable” vehicle qualified as a motor vehicle as defined under the Criminal Code. The issue arose in the following context. Section 223 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, provided that it was an offence to have care or control of a motor vehicle so long as one's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug. At the time the police found the accused, he was sitting behind the wheel of his car with the key in the ignition. The car was in a ditch and could not move under its own power until extricated by a tow truck. The trial judge concluded that the accused had care or control but that the circumstances did not pose a risk of danger and the accused’s vehicle did not qualify as a vehicle for the purposes of s. 223. On this basis the accused was acquitted, but that decision was reversed on appeal. When the matter came before the Supreme Court, the issue was framed as a stated question: “Is an automobile, which cannot be set in motion by its own power, by reason of conditions existing at the time of the alleged offence, a 'motor vehicle' within the meaning of those words where they appear in the phrase 'care [or] control of a motor vehicle' in section 223 of the Criminal Code?” The Supreme Court answered “yes” to that question and the conviction stood. The ratio of the Court's decision is found in the following two sentences (at p. 290):



The definitions of the offences mentioned in ss. 222 and 223 are also couched in a language that is plain and simple and in which nothing, either expressed or implied, indicates an intent of Parliament to exact, in every case, as being one of the ingredients of the offences, the proof of the presence of some element of actual or potential danger or to accept, as a valid defence, the absence of any. On the contrary, these and the other related provisions of the Code manifest the determination of Parliament to strike at the very root of the evil, to wit: the combination of alcohol and automobile, that normally breeds this element of danger which this preventive legislation is meant to anticipate.

[Emphasis is that of Robertson J.A.]





[15]                                   The validity of the Supreme Court’s ultimate holding in Saunders is beyond question: an immoveable vehicle is still a vehicle within the meaning of the Criminal Code. It is the above passage that remains troublesome. It suggests that actual or potential danger to the public is not an essential aspect of the offence. Yet if one were to accept the above passage blindly, it could be argued that a person who is inebriated and sitting in the driver's seat of a car which was resting on blocks, without wheels, transmission and motor, would be guilty of having care or control so long as the keys to the vehicle were in hand or in the ignition. Be that as it may, Saunders supports the Crown’s argument that danger is not an essential element of the offence. The facts of that case fully support the understanding that there was no risk of danger and yet a conviction was entered.



[16]                                   The notion that “risk of danger” is not an essential element of the care or control offence is reinforced in the Supreme Court’s decision in Ford. I pause here to caution that my view of Ford appears to be unique when contrasted with other analyses. However, I feel duty bound to concede that when the facts in Ford are fully unraveled that decision adds further support to the Crown’s argument.



[17]                                   At the time Ford was decided, s. 236(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, stated that it was an offence to have care or control of a motor vehicle, whether in motion or not, if the accused’s blood-alcohol level exceeded the statutory limit. Prior to Ford's release in 1982, and based on the Supreme Court's earlier decision in R. v. Appleby, it was generally assumed that if the case involved the application of the presumption set out in what was then s. 237(1)(a), and if the accused successfully rebutted that presumption, then, the accused was entitled to an acquittal. The prevailing view was that an intention to drive was an essential element of the offence. But in Ford, the majority held otherwise (Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting). In that case, the accused and others had parked their cars in a field during a party held on a chilly March evening. Over the course of the evening, the accused and others would get into the car and turn on the motor to get warm. Once warmed, they would return to the party. Before the party broke up, the police found the accused, awake, behind the wheel of his car, with the motor running and with five or six other party-goers in the vehicle.



[18]                                   The trial judge in Ford accepted the accused’s evidence that he had no intention of driving home that evening and that, in fact, he had arranged for someone else to do the driving at the end of the soiree. (Later in these reasons, this type of argument is referred to as the “firm plan” defence.) The accused was acquitted at trial on the basis that he had rebutted the statutory presumption by demonstrating that he had no intention to set the vehicle in motion. In short, the trial judge held that this lack of intention was a complete defence to the charge, even though on the facts of the case he was prepared to find that care or control had been established. The appeal court disagreed on the issue of intention, as did the majority of the Supreme Court, and both courts referred the matter back to the trial judge for disposition. The Supreme Court majority held that an accused could still be convicted under that provision if the Crown adduces other evidence that the accused performed acts indicative of care or control of the vehicle, so as to create a “danger”. Specifically, the majority referred to the possibility of the accused setting the vehicle in motion “unintentionally”. This understanding of the law is found in the seminal passage, authored by Ritchie J. for the majority, at pp. 248-249:



Nor in my opinion, is it necessary for the Crown to prove an intent to set the vehicle in motion in order to procure a conviction on a charge under [s. 253].... Care or control may be exercised without [an intent to drive] where an accused performs some act or series of acts involving the use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred in this case, whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating the danger the section is designed to prevent.

[Emphasis is that of Robertson J.A.]





[19]                                   The above passage can be interpreted in one of two ways. First, care or control is established once it is proved that the accused was found sitting in the vehicle with the motor running, having performed acts involving “the use of the car, its fittings or equipment.” Pursuant to this understanding, the accused’s interaction with the vehicle is deemed to have posed a risk of danger (e.g., the vehicle could have been put in motion unintentionally). According to this interpretation, there is no need to embark on an inquiry as to whether there was, in fact, a risk of danger that the vehicle might have been unintentionally put in motion; danger is presumed from the surrounding facts. The second possible interpretation is that the accused is guilty of having care or control only if the Crown can prove that there was a risk of the vehicle being moved unintentionally. In my view, the first interpretation appears to be the intended one for the following reason.



[20]                                   All three levels of court in Ford approached the case on the understanding that if “intention to drive” is not an essential element of the offence, the accused was guilty of having care or control by virtue of having occupied the driver’s seat, with the engine running, while in a state of inebriation. The trial judge so held and neither the appeal court, nor the Supreme Court, suggested further proof was required. Moreover, neither court even raised the possibility of the trial judge addressing the question of whether or not the accused’s vehicle could have been moved unintentionally. Indeed, one is left with the distinct impression that the matter was being referred back to the trial judge for the limited purpose of imposing a fit sentence. The dissenting opinion rendered in the Supreme Court supports this understanding. In one solitary sentence, the minority held, at page 242, that even if it were wrong with respect to the issue of whether an intention to drive is an essential element of the offence, the accused should have been acquitted: “Mr. Ford rebutted the presumption … and the Crown has not in my opinion advanced further evidence sufficient to warrant a finding of care or control.” In other words, contrary to what the trial judge had held, the minority was not persuaded that care or control was established simply because the accused was found behind the wheel of his vehicle, impaired, with the motor running.



[21]                                   I accept that the decisions in Saunders and Ford are consistent with the view that risk of danger or risk to public safety is not an essential element of the offence. So long as there is a sufficient interaction between the accused and the vehicle’s fittings a conviction is warranted. In brief, based on those cases, an accused who has had too much to drink and who is found sitting in the front seat of a vehicle with the key in the ignition or the motor running is guilty of the offence. This would be true even if the vehicle were incapable of moving other than by means of a tow truck. However, the ultimate question is whether this elementary understanding of the law is consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Toews. With hindsight being what it is, it should come as no surprise that just as the judicial makeup of the Supreme Court changed in the 1980s, so too did the direction in the law of care or control.



[22]                                   In 1985, the Supreme Court had a further opportunity to consider the elements of the care or control offence, only this time the relevant provision was found at s. 234(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34: “Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol [,] ... has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an ... offence...”. The essential facts of Toews are as follows. The police found the accused asleep on the front seat of his truck, wrapped in a sleeping bag, with his head by the passenger door. The truck was parked on private property with the key in the ignition and the stereo blaring, but the engine was not running. While there was no evidence as to who put the key in the ignition, the evidence established that a friend had driven the accused to the party that both were attending. The trial judge also found that the accused’s friend had agreed to drive the accused home at the end of the evening. The accused left the party early and went to the truck to wait for his friend to return. While waiting, he fell asleep, which state he was still in when the police found him. The accused was convicted at trial. While the trial judge accepted the accused’s evidence that he had no intention of driving, the trial judge concluded that the accused could have awoken, changed his mind and driven the vehicle. On appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the issue focused on defining the mens rea and the actus reus of the “care or control” offence. The Court of Appeal asked whether a person could have care or control if his or her intention was to sleep in the vehicle rather than to drive it. The Court went on to hold that the Crown must prove that the accused had the intention to use the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. In the end, the Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision and acquitted the accused because the Crown had failed to establish that he had the intention to use the “vehicle as a vehicle”. In effect, the appeal court held that the accused’s vehicle was being used as a “bedroom” and not as a vehicle in the conventional manner.



[23]                                   The appeal to the Supreme Court focused on defining the mens rea and the actus reus of the offence.  The mens rea was defined as the intent to assume care or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug. The actus reus was defined as the act of assuming care or control when the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug has impaired the ability to drive”. See also R. v. Penno, at p. 877, where Lamer C.J. discusses this issue in more detail. The Supreme Court went on in Toews to confirm the principle that the absence of intent to drive does not by itself afford the accused a complete defence. However, the Court also held that the statutory presumption did not apply on the facts of the case as the accused was found lying across the front seat with his head on the passenger side. The presumption being inapplicable, the Court held that the Crown was left with the task of establishing “actual” care or control. Two decisions of this Court are cited with approval as examples of the meaning of care or control.



[24]                                   The first is R. v. Thomson (1940), 1940 CanLII 292 (NB CA), 75 C.C.C. 141 (N.B.C.A.), in which the accused was found inebriated and sitting behind the wheel of his car. The motor was not running and, in fact, the ignition key was stashed above the sun visor. The accused was convicted at trial but acquitted on appeal because he had no intention of driving. At p. 143 Chief Justice Baxter gave an example of the distinction: “‘care’ is intended to cover such a case as an intoxicated driver placing his vehicle, without applying the brakes, in such a situation that it may run away and occasion danger to the public”. This passage suggests that if there is a risk of the vehicle being put in motion unintentionally, the accused may be convicted of the offence. The other decision of this Court cited in Toews is R. v. Price (1978), 1978 CanLII 2288 (NB CA), 21 N.B.R. (2d) 532 (C.A.), [1978] N.B.J. No. 91 (QL). The accused in that case drove his car into the ditch and was standing beside the vehicle, with the key in the ignition, when the police arrived. The trial judge’s finding of care or control was affirmed on appeal essentially for the reasons given in Saunders. Writing for the Court, Limerick J.A. made the following observations at p. 539:



The mischief sought to be prohibited by the section as expressed by the wording is that an intoxicated person who is in the immediate presence of a motor vehicle with the means of controlling it or setting it in motion is or may be a danger to the public. Even if he has no immediate intention of setting it in motion he can at any instant determine to do so, because his judgment may be so impaired that he cannot foresee the possible consequences of his actions.





[25]                                   The above quote is important because it reaffirms that the legal concept of “care or control” embraces situations in which the accused's possession of a vehicle poses a risk to public safety. The risk arises because an accused who has no intention of driving the vehicle, initially, could change his or her mind. In cases where an accused is found “sleeping it off” in a vehicle, there is always the risk that the person might awaken from a drunken stupor and decide to drive while under the mistaken notion that he or she is no longer impaired. The trial judge in Toews accepted this “change-of-mind” argument and the Supreme Court referred to it at p. 121 of its reasons for judgment. However, by necessary implication, we must assume that the Supreme Court found the argument unpersuasive as the Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the trial judge’s conviction. As to the Supreme Court's reasoning, we are left only with the solitary passage found at pp. 126-127:



The cases cited, however, illustrate the point and lead to the conclusion that acts of care or control, short of driving, are acts which involve some use of the car or its fittings and equipment, or some course of conduct associated with the vehicle which would involve a risk of putting the vehicle in motion so that it could become dangerous. Each case will depend on its own facts and the circumstances in which acts of care or control may be found will vary widely. In Ford, the appellant's vehicle and others were in a field open to the public. A drinking party was in progress in the car, and the appellant had occupied the driver's seat and had turned on the ignition on various occasions to operate the heater as the party progressed. These facts were considered sufficient to establish care or control. In the case at bar the vehicle was on private property and the respondent was not in occupation of the driver's seat. He was unconscious and clearly not in de facto control. The fact of his use of a sleeping bag would support his statement that he was merely using the vehicle as a place to sleep. There remains the fact that the key was in the ignition and that the stereo was playing. Strangely enough, however, there is no direct evidence that the respondent put the key in the ignition or turned on the stereo, and the evidence is that the last driver of the vehicle was his friend, who drove him to the party and who was to drive him home. I consider that in view of all the circumstances described above no adverse inference should be drawn in this case on the basis of the ignition key evidence alone. It has not been shown then that the respondent performed any acts of care or control and he has therefore not performed the actus reus.

[Emphasis is that of Robertson J.A.]





[26]                                   The first sentence of the above passage is often viewed to be of critical significance. Arguably, the placement of the comma before “or some course of conduct” suggests that are two distinct ways of establishing care or control. First, care or control, short of driving, can be established if there is sufficient interaction between the accused and the vehicle’s “fittings or equipment”. Under this approach, it is unnecessary for the Crown to establish that there was also a risk of danger. Second, the offence of care or control is proven if it can be established that the accused was engaged in a course of conduct associated with the vehicle that would involve the risk of putting the vehicle in motion, which normally entails a risk of danger. Regrettably the Supreme Court does not explain the impact of the full sentence. Instead, it begins to compare and contrast the facts in Ford with those in Toews. The conclusion ultimately drawn from the facts is that the accused was using the vehicle as a place to sleep and none of the remaining facts, including the presence of the keys in the ignition, were found sufficient to hold otherwise. As to the risk of the accused putting the vehicle in motion, we must accept that the Court was not persuaded that such a risk existed. One wonders why. Was the Supreme Court satisfied that, had the accused awoken from his drunken stupor, there was no risk of him putting the vehicle in motion? Was the Court satisfied that the arrangements the accused had made with respect to being driven home at the end of the evening, coupled with the fact that he was wrapped in a sleeping bag with his head on the passenger side, were sufficient to jettison the change-of-mind argument? There is no ready answer.



[27]                                   In summary, while both Saunders and Ford support the understanding that “actual or potential danger” is neither an essential element of the offence, nor is the absence of danger a defence, the Toews’ decision departs from that understanding by referring to case law that raises the notion that risk of danger is a relevant consideration. Curiously, Toews makes no reference to Saunders and the only significant reference to Ford is for comparative purposes. Moreover, the facts in Toews come perilously close to those in Ford and yet the accused in Toews was acquitted of the offence. This leads one to ask whether the fact that the motor was found running in Ford, but not in Toews, is a defining feature of the law of care or control in Canada. If so, are we to attribute that defining feature to the comma before the disjunctive word “or” in a solitary passage of the Supreme Court decision in Toews? Surely not. In light of this analytical vacuum, courts have tended to fall back on another sentence from the above passage when addressing the issue of care or control: “Each case will depend on its own facts and the circumstances in which care or control may be found will very widely.”



[28]                                   While the Supreme Court decisions in Penno and Whyte are not directly on point, there is a passage from each decision that supports the argument that danger is an essential element of the offence. First, there is the oft-cited passage from the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Lamer (speaking for himself) in Penno. He explains the ratio of Toews in the following manner (at p. 877):



The law, however, is not deprived of any flexibility and does not go so far as to punish the mere presence of an individual whose ability to drive is impaired in a motor vehicle. In fact, Toews stands for the proposition that when a person uses a vehicle in a way that involves no risk of putting it in motion so that it could become dangerous, the courts should find that the actus reus was not present.





[29]                                   The other passage is from Whyte in which Chief Justice Dickson, writing for a unanimous court, explains the legislative purpose underscoring the statutory presumption. It was adopted by Parliament to make it more difficult for an accused to avoid conviction on the ground that he or she was too impaired to assume control of the vehicle. At the same time the Court concluded that the provision represented a “restrained parliamentary response to a pressing social problem”. At paragraph 49, Chief Justice Dickson wrote:



Parliament has attempted to strike a balance. On the one hand, the Crown need only prove a minimal level of intent on account of the fact that consumption of alcohol is itself an ingredient of the offence. On the other hand, where an accused can show that he or she had some reason for entering the vehicle and occupying the driver's seat other than to drive the vehicle, the accused will escape conviction. Viewed in this light, s. 237(1)(a) constitutes a minimal interference with the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the Charter.

[Emphasis that of Robertson J.A.]





[30]                                   In my respectful view, there is sufficient ambiguity in the Supreme Court jurisprudence to permit this Court to address the broader policy question of whether danger should be an essential element of the offence. Having regard to the ambiguity and to the fact that the issue at hand has never been squarely addressed by the Supreme Court, I am prepared to proceed as though this were a case of first impression. In reaching this conclusion, I find comfort in knowing that the three lead decisions of the Court are noted for their relative brevity, a fact which supports the view that the Supreme Court was only interested in the narrow issue placed before it. Also, it has not escaped my attention that on no less than three occasions the Supreme Court has refused to grant leave to appeal a finding that danger is an essential element of the offence (discussed below). Admittedly, a refusal to grant leave cannot be equated with an endorsement of the underlying decision. But when the issue is at the heart of the law of “care or control” and divides the appellate courts of this country, and yet leave to appeal is denied in those cases where danger has been deemed an essential element of the offence, an appellate court cannot be faulted for examining the issue anew. So far as the doctrine of stare decisis is concerned, I am permitted to limit the binding effect of each Supreme Court decision to the narrow issue actually decided. In Saunders, the issue was focused on the statutory definition of “motor vehicle”. In Ford, the issue was whether an intention to drive was an essential element of the offence. In Toews, the Supreme Court defined the mens rea and actus reus of the offence while recognizing that the absence of an intent to drive does not by itself afford the accused a full defence. The Crown is entitled to establish actual care or control based on other evidence. Whether that evidence must support a finding of danger is what the case at bar is all about.



V.        The Appellate Jurisprudence – Post-Toews



[31]                                   Before dealing with the broader policy question of whether danger should be considered an essential element of the offence, I propose to examine some of the post-Toews jurisprudence, followed by an examination of the two pertinent decisions of this Court. In the years following Toews, Whyte and Penno, no less than four provincial courts of appeal have adopted the position that an inquiry as to “risk of danger” is an essential element of the analytical framework for deciding care or control cases, save in one instance. In cases where the accused is unable to rebut the statutory presumption with respect to the intention to drive, the accused is deemed to have had care or control and, therefore, there is no need to undertake a danger inquiry. Danger is presumed. Subject to that exception, none of the courts found the Supreme Court jurisprudence an impediment to concluding that a finding of danger is an essential element of the offence.  The first in time was the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Wren (2000), 2000 CanLII 5674 (ON CA), 47 O.R. (3d) 544 (C.A.), [2000] O.J. No. 756 (QL), para. 25, leave to appeal refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 235 (QL). That decision represents a direct challenge to Saunders as the accused in Wren was found sitting in the driver’s seat, inebriated. The car was immoveable and inoperable because of the damage sustained after it slammed into a ditch. The accused was acquitted of the offence, having rebutted the presumption that he intended to drive and there being no risk of danger to the public. Compare Wren with the earlier precedents: R. v. Moffatt (1988), 31 O.A.C. 144, [1988] O.J. No. 1760 (QL), leave to appeal refused, 36 O.A.C. 213n; R. v. Lackovic (1989), 1988 CanLII 7075 (ON CA), 29 O.A.C. 382, [1988] O.J. No. 1732 (QL)); and R. v. Alatyppo (1983), 1983 CanLII 3581 (ON CA), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 514 (Ont. C.A.), [1983] O.J. No. 55 (QL).



[32]                                   It is important to note that Wren does not contradict the Supreme Court’s ruling on the principle issue in Saunders: what constitutes a vehicle for purposes of the Criminal Code? Far from it. A vehicle that is inoperable is still a motor vehicle and its use may pose a risk of harm to public safety. For example, assume that a vehicle has no motor or that it is out of gas. Assume also that the accused is apprehended pushing the vehicle onto a public thoroughfare. The fact that the vehicle is inoperable would not provide the accused with a defence. In these circumstances, the inoperable vehicle poses a risk of danger because it is moveable: R. v. Vansickle, [1988] O.J. No. 2935 (Dist.Ct.)(QL), leave to appeal denied [1990] O.J. No. 3235 (C.A.)(QL). See generally: R. v. Wren, supra; R. v. McBrine, [2007] O.J. No. 142 (QL), 2007 ONCA 25; R. v. Trinder, [2004] O.J. No. 1969 (QL), 2004 ONCJ 37; R. v. Hayes (2007), 253 N.S.R. (2d) 235, [2007] N.S.J. No. 96 (QL), 2007 NSSC 74; R. v. Ringuet, [2006] J.Q. No. 15532 (QL), 2006 QCCS 6549; R. v. Buckley (2002), 221 Sask.R. 152, [2002] S.J. No. 409 (QL), 2002 SKQB 281; R. v. Sharun (2000), 81 Alta. L.R. (3d) 267, [2000] A.J. No. 400 (QL), 2000 ABQB 229; R. v. Van Oosterhout, [2004] O.J. No 5149 (QL), 2004 ONCJ 328; and R. v. Swann, [2002] O.J. No. 4488 (Sup.Ct.)(QL).



[33]                                   The Wren decision was applied by the majority of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal at para. 24 of R. v. Decker (2002), 209 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 44, [2002] N.J. No. 38 (QL), 2002 NFCA 9, leave to appeal refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 145 (QL). The Court of Appeal held that as general rule danger is an essential element of the offence. The accused in that case was acquitted in circumstances where he was found behind the wheel of his vehicle, impaired, with the motor running. In R. v. Burbella (2002), 166 Man.R. (2d) 199, [2002] M.J. No. 355 (QL), 2002 MBCA 106, para. 22, the Manitoba Court of Appeal had before it a factual scenario similar to that in Wren and adopted the same legal position. Finally, in R. v. Shuparski (2003), 232 Sask.R. 1, [2003] S.J. No. 147 (QL), 2003 SKCA 22, leave to appeal refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 167 (QL), the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held at para. 18 that: “Whatever doubt some of the jurisprudence has raised over the need for an element of ‘dangerousness’ has, in my respectful view, been dispelled by [Wren, Decker and Burbella]. I note that Wren was cited by the dissenting justice in R. v. MacAulay (2002), 218 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 312, [2002] P.E.I.J. No. 101 (QL), 2002 PESCAD 24, but that case offers a unique fact situation. Before the police were asked to intervene, a third party had taken the keys from the ignition while the accused was sleeping-it-off. The legal issue focused on the statutory presumption and the time for assessing whether the accused had an intention to drive.



[34]                                   On the other hand, there are four post-Toews appellate decisions that support the Crown’s contention that “danger” is not an essential element of the offence. However, all were decided prior to Wren and only one of the decisions expressly asks the question whether danger is or should be an essential element of the offence. In R. v. Decker, supra, the dissenting justice indicated that simply placing the key in the ignition was sufficient control to trigger s. 253 of the Criminal Code. Relying on Saunders, he opined that that there is no need for the Crown to demonstrate an additional “risk of danger”. The second case that supports the Crown’s argument is R. v. Green (1989), 1989 ABCA 290 (CanLII), 100 A.R. 131 (C.A.), [1989] A.J. No. 1002 (QL). As the facts of that case closely resemble those under consideration, it is only fair to repeat what is stated in the appeal court’s “Memorandum for Judgment”. The accused was staying overnight at a hotel following an evening of drinking. At 6:00 a.m., the accused, while still in a state of inebriation, went to his vehicle located in the hotel parking lot to retrieve some documents needed for work. Although his wife had called a cab for him, for some unexplained reason the accused started his truck, then turned the motor off, got out and locked the doors. He was already heading back to the hotel when the police intervened. The Crown did not rely on the statutory presumption, and it was accepted that “there [was] no reason to believe that [the accused] did not intend to go to work in that cab.” The majority concluded that the actus reus was completed when the engine was started as that was when the “risk of putting the vehicle in motion” arose. In other words, there is no need to undertake a risk inquiry, as the acts themselves were sufficient to deem the presence of danger. However, Green appears to conflict with two subsequent decisions of the Alberta Court of Appeal: R. v. Gent, [1997] A.J. No. 72 (C.A.)(QL) and R. v. Friesen, [1991] A.J. No. 811 (C.A.)(QL), the facts of which are reported in R. v. Ganpatt (1995), 1995 CanLII 18030 (AB QB), 177 A.R. 311 (Q.B.), [1995] A.J. No. 1139 (QL). Note also that in R. v. Armstrong, [2005] A.J. No. 623 (QL), 2005 ABCA 195, the accused sought leave to appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal on the ground that the Green decision conflicted with the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s decision in Shuparski. A single judge of the Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed the application on the basis that there was no conflict.



[35]                                     The third case which, on its facts and in the result, supports the Crown’s position is R. v. Lockerby (1999), 180 N.S.R. (2d) 115, [1999] N.S.J. No. 349 (QL), 1999 NSCA 122. The accused and friends had been drinking and were driven to a restaurant by a friend of the accused. When they arrived, the driver placed the transmission in neutral with the parking brake engaged, got out of the vehicle and entered the restaurant to look for other friends. While still in the vehicle, the accused and the other occupants decided that they would eat at the restaurant regardless of whether the other friends were found inside. The accused then moved to the driver's seat to place the transmission in park and turn the motor off. This was done without moving the car. The police approached the accused while he was still sitting behind the wheel of the vehicle. At trial, the accused admitted that he could have changed his mind about driving. The trial judge found that the accused had not occupied the driver's seat for the purpose of putting the vehicle in motion and, therefore, the statutory presumption had been rebutted. However, the accused was convicted of having actual care or control based on the facts outlined. The accused’s appeals to the summary conviction appeal court and the Court of Appeal respectively were dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that “[a] person who has the present ability to operate the vehicle, who has its superintendence or management, is in control of it.” It remains to be decided whether this statement was meant to reject the notion of danger as an essential component of the offence.



[36]                                   The fourth case that supports the Crown’s contention that danger is not an essential component of the offence is R. v. Rousseau (1997), 1997 CanLII 10217 (QC CA), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 571 (Q.C.C.A.), [1997] J.Q. No. 3925 (QL). The accused was found asleep and impaired behind the wheel, with the motor running and the gear lever in park. He had pulled over in order to sleep-it-off. The Crown elected not to invoke the statutory presumption, arguing that care or control could be established having regard to the accused’s use of the car’s fittings and equipment. The argument was rejected at trial and the accused was acquitted. The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge, overturning the trial judge, was affirmed on appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal. In its reasons, the Court of Appeal had this to say at pp. 575-76 [TRANSLATION]: “Care or control of an automobile is the exercise in fact of a legal prerogative. It is the use of a vehicle or its fittings or equipment in the manner authorized by ownership or possession. The element of risk or public danger which is inferred from the relevant sections of the Criminal Code results from the co-existence of two factors: impairment by alcohol or drugs and the fact that the accused consciously puts himself in a position which may become dangerous.” As I read this passage, the Crown need not prove danger. Danger is to be inferred. Quaere: whether on the facts of the case, the accused would have been found guilty even if danger had been considered an essential component of the offence. See discussion below.



VI.      The New Brunswick Jurisprudence / The Sleeping-it-Off Cases



[37]                                   Before turning to the two decisions of this Court that bear on the issue at hand, it is necessary to offer an overview of the arguments and counterarguments that arise in the context of the “sleeping-it-off” jurisprudence. I do so in order to provide context to the New Brunswick cases, both of which involve this factual pattern, as do Decker and Shuparski, referred to above. Those decisions build upon the legal argument first advanced and implicitly accepted in Toews. The case law, arguments and issues have been canvassed thoroughly in three relatively recent decisions: Hannemann is one, another is R. v. Smith (2005), 235 N.S.R. (2d) 253, [2005] N.S.J. No. 307 (QL), 2005 NSSC 191, and finally there is the decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge in R. v. Ogrodnick (2006), 393 A.R. 6, [2006] A.J. No. 340 (QL), 2006 ABQB 91, reversed on appeal, (2007), 409 A.R. 56, [2007] A.J. No. 514 (QL), 2007 ABCA 161, application for leave to appeal dismissed, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 324 (QL). As these three cases offer an extensive analysis of the issues and the jurisprudence, it is easier to explain their legal significance by outlining the arguments and issues that typically arise in the sleeping-it-off jurisprudence.



[38]                                   The typical sleeping-it-off case is one in which the police find the accused inebriated and sleeping behind the wheel of his vehicle. (I cannot recall a care or control case where the accused was a female.) Sometimes the motor is running and sometimes it is not. Invariably, the accused is able to rebut the statutory presumption by persuading the trial judge that he did not occupy the driver's seat for the purpose of putting the vehicle in motion (driving). He simply wanted to sleep it off. If at the time the police intervened the motor was running, the accused will maintain that it was for the purpose of generating necessary warmth (the vehicle as “bedroom and heater” defence). Irrespective of whether the motor was running, the Crown will counter with the argument that there was still a risk of the accused putting the vehicle in motion. But for the intervention of the police, the accused might have awoken from his drunken stupor and decided to drive while under the mistaken belief that he was no longer impaired. The Crown contends that a person who is sleeping it off and subsequently awakens is in no position to assess his or her own sobriety and cites, for example, R. v. Shave, [2005] M.J. No. 16 (Prov.Ct.)(QL), as a practical illustration of this point. But the debate does not end here.



[39]                                   The accused responds to the Crown's change-of-mind argument with several counterarguments. First, the accused insists that even if the change-of-mind argument represents a valid concern, the existence of the concern is not by itself a sufficient basis for entering a conviction under s. 253. To hold otherwise would mean that the law is prepared to convict a person on the threshold standard of “mere possibility”. With respect to this particular argument, the accused properly cites Toews as an example of a case in which that threshold standard was implicitly rejected. Second, applying Toews, it is argued that the trial judge must take into account all of the circumstances when evaluating the risk of the accused undergoing a change of mind with respect to putting the vehicle in motion. To that end, the typical accused will attempt to persuade the trial judge that the attendant facts do not support the understanding that, but for the intervention of the police, he would have acted irrationally and changed his mind about driving. To undermine the change-of-mind argument, the accused will offer evidence to establish that adequate measures were taken to diminish the risk to public safety, such as that he had made firm arrangements to have someone else drive the vehicle home, or that he had already called a cab and was waiting to be picked up when the police arrived (the “firm plan” defence).



[40]                                   In Hanneman, Justice Hill offers an exhaustive analysis of the case law. He observes at para. 51 that in cases where the accused was found sleeping it off with the engine running, five appellate courts, between 1986 and 2000, sustained findings of care or control: “Turning on the ignition amounts to a substantial act involving a vehicle’s fittings or equipment - conduct almost always characterized as an act of care or control”. However, Justice Hill goes on to conclude that in none of the appellate decisions was there a “firm or detailed plan of any sort countering the prospect that the accused could, at any time, awaken and in an impaired state misjudge recovery to drive.” By contrast, the accused in the appellate decisions of Decker and Shuparski were acquitted because of the acceptance of the so-called “firm plan” defence. More recently, the defence was found wanting in another appellate decision, Ogrodnick. Arguably, the jurisprudence reveals a subtle but perceptible difference in judicial attitudes when it comes to deciding this kind of case and, in particular, when it comes to evaluating the firm-plan defence. However, each case must be decided on its own facts. It falls on the accused to convince the trial judge that the counterargument/defence outweighs the Crown’s contention that someone found sleeping it off in a vehicle is in no position to maintain that he or she was exercising sound judgment. Accepting all of this to be so, what is clear is that danger is being regarded as an essential element of the offence. The fact that the accused was found inebriated, or with a blood-alcohol level exceeding the statutory limit, in the front seat, with the motor running is no longer determinative.



[41]                                   I am now in a position to address the two New Brunswick cases decided post-Toews. The first in time is R. v. Diotte (1991), 1991 CanLII 2407 (NB CA), 115 N.B.R. (2d) 195 (C.A.), [1991] N.B.J. No. 323 (QL). The facts are straightforward. The police came upon a car parked sideways in the middle of a public street and blocking one lane of travel. The accused was asleep in the front seat, with his head on the passenger side and his feet in the area of the gas and brake pedals. He was also inebriated. At trial, the accused was acquitted and the appeal to the summary conviction appeal court judge was dismissed. The appeal to this Court was allowed. Chief Justice Stratton elaborated, at pp. 204-205, on what is meant by “risk to public safety”:



I think it is a reasonable inference from the established facts that the position of the motor vehicle on the thoroughfare presented an immediate hazard and danger to the members of the public using it. Moreover, as Mr. Diotte had the immediate capacity and means of operating the vehicle, it is my opinion that there existed in this case the risk that Mr. Diotte would put the vehicle in motion and it would become a greater danger to the public.





[42]                                   As I read Diotte, a conviction under s. 253 would have been justified on two bases. First, the placement of the accused’s vehicle in the middle of a public thoroughfare gave rise to an immediate hazard and danger to the public. In other words, Diotte supports the understanding that irrespective of whether there was a risk of the vehicle being put in motion, a risk to public safety can arise in other ways. Thus, for example, the inebriated person sitting on the side of the road with keys in pocket, his or her vehicle in the middle of the highway, its engine turned off, emergency brake engaged and the transmission placed in “Park”, is going to find it difficult to avoid a conviction under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. While an accused may establish that he or she had no intention of driving or that there was no risk of putting the vehicle in motion, either intentionally or otherwise, the placement of the vehicle on a public thoroughfare is sufficient for establishing that the accused's interaction with the vehicle posed an immediate risk to public safety.



[43]                                   The second basis on which the accused in Diotte was convicted can be tied to the understanding that as the accused had the capacity to operate his vehicle, and even though he was found asleep in the front seat, he posed a danger or risk to public safety. That finding is unassailable given the absence of any evidence to support the “firm plan” defence, which was never advanced in Diotte.



[44]                                   The other relevant decision of this Court is R. v. Clarke (P) (1997), 1997 CanLII 23206 (NB CA), 188 N.B.R. (2d) 123 (C.A.), [1997] N.B.J. No. 154 (QL). In that case, the police found the impaired accused asleep at the wheel of his vehicle. The car was found parked in a parking lot, with its engine running and its lights on. The accused was convicted at trial, but that decision was reversed by the summary conviction appeal court judge on the basis that the accused did not pose a danger to others because he had no intention of driving. This Court properly restored the conviction. Writing for the Court, Justice Bastarache (now of the Supreme Court) endorsed Diotte while elaborating on the required elements of the offence (at paras. 8 and 9):





The care and control offence lies not in the intention to drive the vehicle, but in voluntarily becoming intoxicated and in taking some actions by which the offender is involved with the vehicle in a way which may cause danger to the public. ...



There is no necessity of proving that the offender was posing an immediate danger to the public in order to find him guilty. It is the possibility that the vehicle may be put in motion, intentionally or unintentionally, by a person who is intoxicated, that poses a problem of public safety. …





[45]                                   Nowhere in Clarke does it say that danger is not an essential element of the offence. Admittedly, one can safely presume that danger is present once it is established that the accused was found sitting behind the wheel with the motor running, having regard to the risk of the accused changing his or her mind about driving. As in Diotte, there is no indication that the accused advanced the firm-plan defence. In the absence of such an argument it is going to be presumed that someone who is inebriated and found sleeping behind the wheel of their car poses a danger to public safety. But this does not mean that danger is not an essential element of the offence.



VII.      Should Danger be an Essential Element?



[46]                                   Having determined that it is open to this Court to decide whether danger is an essential element of the offence, the question remains whether this Court should follow the lead of the other appellate courts that have decided in the affirmative. My position is not complicated. If danger is not already an essential element of the offence, it should be, with one exception. In cases where the Crown invokes the statutory presumption and the accused is unable to rebut it, the accused is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle pursuant to s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Hence, there is no need to embark on a danger inquiry. This leads us to identify valid policy reasons for accepting that danger is otherwise an essential element of the offence.  I begin with the proposition that such an element is consistent with the purpose and objectives of the legislation. The provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with impaired driving have as their immediate objective the elimination of harm to the public. Section 253 makes it an offence to operate a vehicle (drive) when one’s ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or, if the vehicle is not in motion, to have care or control of it. This provision empowers police officers to detain and arrest those who pose an immediate or potential threat to public safety. Those caught driving while impaired represent the immediate threat. Those who have care or control represent a potential threat or risk of harm. The elimination of danger or risk of harm is central to the objectives of the legislation. Hence, one would assume that if a person’s interaction with his or her vehicle did not pose an immediate or potential risk of harm or risk to public safety, a conviction under s. 253 would not fall within the objectives of the legislation. In other words, courts should not be convicting those who do not represent this threat. Legally, it makes no sense to eliminate danger as an essential component of the offence and to insist that a conviction can rest on the extent of the accused’s interaction with the vehicle’s fittings or equipment (the “sufficient interaction” test). Intuitively, every lay person knows that someone sitting drunk behind the wheel of car, with the motor running, has care or control of the vehicle, but it falls to the legally trained to explain why in criminal law the concept of care or control involves more.



[47]                                   It is easier to defend the position that danger should be an essential element of the offence by attacking the validity of the sufficient-interaction test for assessing care or control. It seems draconian in the age of the Charter to hold that a person may be convicted of having care or control of a vehicle while impaired, even though the accused had no intention of putting the vehicle in motion and the facts do not otherwise support a finding of risk to public safety. To hold that neither the intent to drive nor the presence of danger is an essential element of the offence is to risk the criticism that the offence bears too close a resemblance to an absolute liability offence. Admittedly, the mens rea for the offence persists (the intent to assume care or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol), but the notion that the accused cannot speak to his or her presence in a vehicle while in a state of inebriation is arguably inconsistent with fundamental principles of criminal law. Indeed the whole purpose of having the statutory presumption set out in s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is to protect the public interest without exposing an accused to an absolute liability offence. Chief Justice Dickson wrote in Whyte at paragraph 47:



This history shows that there is a serious problem with the mental element of this offence, because the fact of intoxication itself raises doubts about the accused's mental state and ability to form an intention. The presumption was created by Parliament in response to that history. On the one hand, it was repugnant to theories of criminal liability that a person could be convicted of an absolute liability crime, with no possibility of a defence based on the mental state of the accused. On the other hand, as the Minister of Justice commented, it is shocking to hear that an accused could be acquitted of an offence for which consumption of alcohol is a required element, because he was too intoxicated to be guilty. The presumption was added to resolve the problems caused by both of these alternatives. Parliament wished to discourage intoxicated people from even placing themselves in a position where they could set a vehicle in motion, while at the same time providing a way for a person to avoid liability when there was a reason for entering the vehicle other than to set it in motion. The position adopted is admittedly a compromise. It is an attempt to balance the dangers posed by a person whose abilities to reason are impaired by alcohol with the desire to avoid absolute liability offences. It is an attempt by Parliament to recognize that alcohol, because of its effects on the reasoning process, may in some cases require a special treatment, while avoiding absolute liability offences.

[Emphasis that of Robertson J.A.]





[48]                                    It has not escaped my attention that once the sufficient-interaction test (starting the motor) is accepted as a means of establishing care or control, the Crown no longer needs to rely on the statutory presumption in cases where the accused is found in the driver’s seat. Indeed, in Rousseau, the Crown elected not to rely on the presumption, presumably for the reason that it is easier to establish guilt. There is no purpose to invoking the statutory presumption and asking the accused to establish that he or she had no intention of driving if all that the law requires is proof of three simple facts: the accused was inebriated, the accused was found sitting behind the wheel, and the motor was running. What is troublesome, however, is that the sufficient-interaction test has the effect of defeating one of the legislative purposes underscoring the statutory presumption: to ensure that s. 253 of the Criminal Code does not become an absolute liability offence.



[49]                                   The sufficient-interaction approach or test for determining care or control is also misleading. Let me explain. If the Crown is permitted to establish care or control by showing a sufficient interaction between the accused and the vehicle’s fittings or equipment then a question logically arises: what constitutes sufficient interaction for the purposes of establishing guilt? If one reviews the jurisprudence, there is only one obvious answer: when the accused starts the motor. The case law indicates that the placement of the key in the ignition is by itself insufficient to sustain a finding of guilt and the same holds true with respect to the operation of the car stereo: Toews. We also know that the use of a taxi radio to report an accident does not lead to criminal liability: Whyte at p. 19 referring to Appleby. This leaves us with only one other obvious act: starting the motor to the vehicle over which care or control is being alleged. But why is this act alone sufficient for purposes of establishing care or control? I have no answer to that question. Nor has anyone attempted to explain why the law should not look into all of the circumstances leading up to the accused’s arrest before deciding whether care or control has been established.



[50]                                   If I am correct in my assertion that the sufficient-interaction test is not truly a test, but rather a declaration that any one who is found drunk behind the wheel of their vehicle with the motor running is guilty of the offence, then it is clear that the so-called test is open to a further criticism: it leads to arbitrary results. The following hypothetical bears out this allegation. The local Legion closes its doors at 1:00 a.m. and the temperature is thirty below. Before leaving, the impaired patron phones home and arranges with a family member to be picked up within the next twenty minutes. The accused then goes to his car, places himself behind the wheel and starts the engine to keep warm while waiting to be picked up. In the interim, the police arrive on the scene and approach the accused, who is still sitting in the front seat. A minute later, the family member drives up and parks beside the two cars. According to the Crown, the accused would have to be found guilty because he was observed by the police sitting behind the wheel with the engine running. In effect, the Crown would insist that the accused does not have the right to explain the circumstances surrounding his decision to enter the vehicle and start the engine in an impaired state. Now, alter one fact of the hypothetical. Rather than the accused having started the vehicle before the police arrived on the scene, assume that the accused merely placed the keys in the ignition. From the Supreme Court’s decision in Toews, we know that a conviction would not automatically follow. The accused would be permitted to advance the firm-plan defence to the Crown’s change-of-mind argument. On similar facts, the accused in R. v. Friesen, supra, was acquitted of the offence. In my view, the difference between placing the keys in the ignition and using them to start the vehicle’s motor cannot be the determinative factor. Both the distinction and the legal outcome fall within the classification of “arbitrary”. There is no juridical reason for allowing the distinction to bring about different results.



[51]                                   Finally, on a positive note, danger as an essential element of the offence provides a unifying thread which promotes certainty in the law while balancing the rights of an accused with the objectives of the legislation. At present, the data base of Quick Law tells us that there are more than 3,000 care or control cases. It also tells us that it stops counting once the number exceeds 3,000. This is one area of the law that impacts on the daily lives of Canadians who otherwise would never enter the criminal justice system. The financial consequences of a conviction may have something to do with the numbers. But regardless of the reasons for the sheer volume of cases, the law should ensure that like cases are treated alike. As Justice Hill adroitly observed at para. 44 of Hannemann: “[w]hile there are limits to the utility of case-to-case comparisons when each prosecution arises from its own unique facts, a certain organized and unambiguous law should produce like results. While acts of care or control may vary widely, and each case is fact-driven, principled line-drawing should be the objective of a rational legal regime.” I agree, and the way to achieve that objective is to accept that danger is an essential component of the offence.
