[63]                       Those words are based upon a passage from the judgment of Lacourcière, J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Riezebos (1976) 1975 CanLII 1482 (ON CA), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 20, and to which reference was made by Mr. Justice Moir of this Division in his dissenting judgment in R. v. Augustus, Rivett and Sartor (1977) 1977 ALTASCAD 177 (CanLII), 5 A.R. 499.

[64]                       Counsel for Mrs. Gamble then drew our attention to the following passages in the charge:

"Now, with respect to the accused Janice Marie Gamble and the Crown's contention that she was a party to the murder committed by William John Nichols, that is the Crown's position is that he committed the murder and that she was a party to it. With respect to her position as a party, I suggest that you consider the following items of evidence."

[65]                       The presiding judge then referred to:

1. Mrs. Homan's evidence that she saw Janice Gamble pacing back and forth in front of the Credit Union when Gamble and Nichols were inside robbing it.

2. Evidence that Mrs. Gamble's fingerprint was on the hold-up note.

3. The finding of a fully-loaded .38 special pearl-handled revolver at the scene of the shoot-out, near where Mrs. Gamble was knocked or fell down.

4. The conversation in the house regarding a lost gun.

5. The counting of the money.

6. The theft of money from the Thunderbird Motel.

7. The tying-up of the hostages.

8. The holding of knives to the hostages' throats.

[73]                       The next ground of appeal made on behalf of Mrs. Gamble was expressed in these terms by Taschereau, J. in Henderson v. The King (1948) 1948 CanLII 17 (SCC), S.C.R. 226, 237:

"Unfortunately, all these aspects of the case were not dealt with, and these omissions were, I believe, highly prejudicial to the accused. The defence was not presented so as to give it all its force and effect. It is true that no witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant, but it is nevertheless the duty of the trial judge, in his charge to the jury, to explain the exculpatory effect of the evidence, whether it is given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused. Wu v. The King (1934) 1934 CanLII 28 (SCC), S.C.R. 609. It was the fundamental right of the appellant, who has been charged of murder, purely by construction of the law, which in this particular case creates a presumptive guilt, to have all the features of his defence adequately put to the jury."

[74]                       Counsel for Mrs. Gamble submits that the trial judge did not refer to critical portions of the evidence which the defence relied upon as evidence from which no common intent could be inferred. In essence, counsel says that evidence of William Nichols and Tracie Perry favourable to Mrs. Gamble was not mentioned. The items of which he complains are:

(1) that no eyewitness to the shooting saw this appellant do any act which could be considered as resisting arrest.

(2) that no one saw a gun in her possession at any time.

(3) that she fell to the ground and was screaming during the incident.

(4) that the shooting started as she and Tracie Perry were in the process of getting out of the car.

(5) that the appellant was screaming and saying "What is going on" as they left the scene.

(6) the appellant's conduct in the car behind the Credit Union before and after the robbery.

(7) the evidence that the loaded pearl-handled gun was placed on the passenger side by John Gamble, and was found near his glasses on the road.

(8) the evidence as to how the appellant treated the hostages in consoling them and untying them.

(9) the situation in general at the house where the hostages were taken.

[75]                       I do not think a trial judge is obliged to refer to every piece of evidence in favor of an accused. Moreover, he could have mentioned, but did not, some other evidence which, if accepted by the jury, was damaging to Mrs. Gamble:

(a) that she had, on the morning of the robbery, bought the large envelope on which the holdup note was written.

(b) the evidence of the hostage, Mrs. Perry, that Janice Gamble said a spent bullet shell fell out when she took her coat off in the restaurant.

(c) that the only time Mrs. Gamble drove the car was just after the robbery of the Credit Union.

[76]                       It may be appropriate at this stage to refer to the words of Anglin, J. in Picariello et al v The King (1923) 1923 CanLII 536 (SCC), 39 C.C.C. 229 (S. Ct. of Can.), 245:

"No doubt there may be found some sentences in the charge that might have been better expressed; some passages, if isolated, may be open to criticism. But taken as a whole, as it should be, and having regard to the evidence with which the trial Judge was dealing, I do not find any substantial misdirection."

[81]                       There is one final matter, common to both appeals, that must be considered. It is something that did not come up during the trial, and which is not mentioned in any of the factums. The question arose during the course of argument before us. To appreciate the problem it is necessary to consider the following sequence of events, all of which took place in 1976:

March 12 - offences committed

April 29 - Information sworn

June 14 - Peliminary Hearing commences

June 25 - Appellant Nichols committed for trial

June 30 - Appellant Gamble committed for trial

July 26 - Provisions of Criminal Law Amendment Act
(No 2) 1976 proclaimed in force

August 30 - Indictment preferred

[82]                       The jury was charged on the basis of s. 214 as enacted by the Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2) 1976 which came into effect on July 26, 1976. That Act, which I will call the Amendment Act, contained transitional provisions. It is necessary to refer to certain of them:

"26. (1) Where, in proceedings commenced before the coming into force of this Act, a person is found guilty after the coming into force of this Act of an offence punishable by death, whether the offence be treason, piracy or murder, he shall be sentenced therefor and all further proceedings in respect thereof shall be continued as if the offence had been committed after the coming into force of this Act.

(2) Where, in proceedings commenced before the coming into force of this Act, a person is found guilty after the coming into force of this Act of murder that is not punishable by death, he shall be sentenced therefor and all further proceedings in respect thereof shall be continued as if this Act had not come into force.

27. (1) Where proceedings in respect of any offence of treason, piracy or murder, whether punishable by death or not, that was committed before the coming into force of this Act are commenced after the coming into force of this Act, the offence shall be dealt with, inquired into, tried and determined, and any punishment in respect of the offence shall be imposed as if the offence had been committed after the coming into force of this Act irrespective of when it was actually committed.

(2) Where proceedings in respect of any offence of treason, piracy or murder, whether punishable by death or not, were commenced before the coming into force of this Act, and a new trial of a person for the offence has been ordered and the new trial is commenced after the coming into force of this Act, the new trial shall be commenced by the preferring of a new indictment before the court before which the accused is to be tried, and thereafter the offence shall be dealt with, inquired into, tried and determined, and any punishment in respect of the offence shall be imposed as if it had been committed after the coming into force of this Act."
