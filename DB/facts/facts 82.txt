1]               On May 31, 2010, the Crown charged Michael Erin Briscoe [the “Applicant”] by direct indictment with the following four offences under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 [“Criminal Code”]:

 

1.         first degree murder of Ellie‑May Meyer [“Meyer”] pursuant to Criminal Code s. 235(1);        

 

2.         first degree murder of Nina Louise Courtepatte [“Courtepatte”] pursuant to Criminal Code s. 235(1);

 

3.         aggravated sexual assault of Courtepatte pursuant to Criminal Code s. 273(2)(b); and

 

4.         kidnapping of Courtepatte pursuant to Criminal Code, s. 279.

 

Each of the charges set forth in the indictment are referred to as “counts.”

 

[2]               The Applicant’s trial on these charges is scheduled to begin in the early part of April 2011.

 

[3]               The Applicant applies, pursuant to Criminal Code ss. 589 and 591(3), to have this Court sever these counts. In other words, he seeks to have this Court order that he be tried separately on each of the counts by having this Court sever:

 

1.         the non‑murder aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping charges from the murder charges, and

 

2.         the two murders.

 

[4]               The Crown opposes the Applicant’s motion and argues that the interests of justice require these charges be tried at the same time in a single trial.

 

 

II.        Background

 

[5]               A brief description of the Crown’s theory of these offences and the Applicant’s alleged role is helpful to evaluate whether severance is appropriate. It should be noted that for the purposes of this application, neither the Crown nor the Applicant has presented evidence to this Court. This Court has, at best, theories and arguments as to how this matter will unfold as the trial progresses.

 


A.        Meyer

 

[6]               The Crown’s theory is that on April 1, 2005, Meyer, an Edmonton area prostitute, was picked up by the Applicant, Joseph Laboucan [“Laboucan”], and Stephanie Bird [“Bird”] in a vehicle that Bird owned. The Applicant drove the vehicle.

 

[7]               At the time, the Applicant and Bird were in a relationship and stayed together in a rented motel room.

 

[8]               The group travelled to a rural location near Edmonton. Laboucan had sex with Meyer, and then Laboucan and the Applicant beat Meyer to death.

 

[9]               Meyer’s body was recovered on May 6, 2005. Several years later Laboucan’s DNA was identified from Meyer’s body.

 

B.        Courtepatte

 

[10]           The Crown’s theory is that on April 3, 2005, Laboucan and Bird invited Courtepatte and a female friend to a rave. No such rave existed; that story was a ruse. This group met with the Applicant, Michael Williams [“Williams”], and a young female named D.D.T. [“D.D.T.”]. Together, they travelled to an Edmonton area golf course in Bird’s car, with the Applicant driving the vehicle.

 

[11]           The group led Courtepatte onto the golf course, where Bird attacked her. Courtepatte was then sexually assaulted by at least Williams and Laboucan, and then she was assaulted and killed by Williams, Laboucan, and D.D.T. The group, including Courtepatte’s friend, then returned to the motel room that the Applicant and Bird shared.

 

[12]           Laboucan showed Courtepatte’s friend and D.D.T. a severed human finger, which Laboucan claimed was from a past victim, namely, Meyer.

 

[13]           Courtepatte’s body was recovered the following day.
