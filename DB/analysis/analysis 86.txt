Law and Analysis

 

[25]           Having been convicted of second degree murder, Mr. Osei-Agyemang is automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. The issue for my determination is whether the period of his parole ineligibility should be increased over and beyond the statutory minimum of ten years.

 

[26]           Generally in determining what is a fit and proper sentence, regard must be had to the provisions contained in Section 718 through 718.2 of Criminal Code. In particular, regard must be had to the fundamental principle enunciated in Section 718.1 which states as follows:

 

A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

[27]           This Court is also bound by precedent established by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Alberta Court of Appeal. Furthermore, this Court must analyse to determine whether there are any mitigating and aggravating factors present in deciding what is a fit and proper sentence.

 

[28]           I took from Crown counsel’s submissions that the aggravating factors in this case included at least the following:

 

·                     although found not guilty of first degree murder, there was a greater element of planning on the part of Mr. Osei-Agyemang than is often found in second degree murder cases; and

 

·                     Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s comparatively lengthy and serious criminal record.


 

[31]           For his part, counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang cited as mitigating factors the following:

 

·                     Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s relative young age; and

 

·                     that several months prior to the trial, his client had offered to enter a guilty plea to a charge of second degree murder, which offer was rejected by the Crown.

 

[34]           The period of ineligibility for parole is governed by the provisions of Section 745.4 of the Criminal Code which states:

 

Subject to section 745.5, at the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.2, by order, substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than twenty‑five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.

 

[35]           The seminal case dealing with this section is R. v. Shopshire (1995) 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 43 C.R. (4th) 269 (S.C.C.). In that decision, Justice Iacobucci, writing for the Court, stated in para. 29 as follows:

 

In my opinion, a more appropriate standard, which would better reflect the intentions of Parliament, can be stated in this manner: as a general rule, the period of parole ineligibility shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in s. 744 [now s. 745], the offender should wait a longer period before having his suitability to be released into the general public assessed.  To this end, an extension of the period of parole ineligibility would not be "unusual", although it may well be that, in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be awarded.

 

[36]           In his submissions, Crown counsel argued that the primary sentencing objectives in this case ought to be denunciation, deterrence (both specific and general), and separating Mr. Osei-Agyemang from society. (s. 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada)

 

[37]           In that regard, he pointed to Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s criminal record which commenced in 2001 in Youth Court in Montreal. On April 4, 2005, he was convicted in Youth Court of one count of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence and one count of robbery.

 

[38]           His subsequent record as an adult is as follows:

Sec 733.1(1)(B) Cc

(Laval Ps 52623)

 

[39]           At the time he murdered Clifton Anderson, Mr. Osei-Agyemang was the subject of two outstanding probation orders.

 

[40]           Section 745.4 of the Criminal Code mandates four matters to be considered by the sentencing judge. These are:

 

·                     the character of the offender,

·                     the nature of the offence,

·                     the circumstances surrounding its commission, and

·                     the recommendation of the jury.

 

[45]           I will now deal with each consideration in turn. Firstly, the character of the offender. As was stated before, Mr. Osei-Agyemang possesses a serious criminal record. Quite apart from anything else, of concern to me as the sentencing judge is the fact that he was the subject of two probation orders at the time he murdered Clifton Anderson.

 

[46]           Secondly, regarding the nature of the offence. While the jury found that Clifton Anderson’s murder was not planned and deliberate so as to justify a conviction on the charge of first degree murder, as the recitation of the facts above clearly indicates, there was certainly a greater element of planning on Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s part than is often the case where an individual is  convicted of second degree murder.

 


[47]           Thirdly, regarding the circumstances surrounding the murder. Not only was there a complete lack of remorse on the part of Mr. Osei-Agyemang, but he was boastful of this being his first murder.

 

[48]           Lastly, of course, there was no recommendation made by the jury as to the period of parole ineligibility.

 

[49]           In short, we have an individual who committed a brutal murder of a completely innocent individual, a murder in which there was an element of planning. Based on the evidence before this Court, there was no suggestion of any remorse on the part of Mr. Osei-Agyemang. Lastly, it would seem that Mr. Osei-Agyemang has learned little if anything from his prior contacts with the criminal justice system. Certainly, none of it seems to have had a salutary effect upon his behaviour. Therefore, specific deterrence is a particularly important objective in this case as is denunciation.

 

[50]           I do acknowledge the fact that Mr. Osei-Agyemang through his counsel was prepared several months ago to enter a plea of guilty to second degree murder. I accept that as a mitigating factor. However, in so doing, I am in no way criticizing the actions of the Crown who felt that the facts of this case justified proceeding to trial on the original charge.

 

[51]           Counsel for Mr. Osei-Agyemang cited the decision of R. v. Diep, 2005 CarswellAlta 151 in support of his proposition that the period of parole ineligibility ought not to be raised above the statutory minimum of ten years. In Diep, the accused was convicted of second degree murder in the stabbing death of his former wife. Notwithstanding the deemed aggravating factor of it being an (ex-) spousal homicide, the learned justice declined to increase the period of parole ineligibility beyond the statutory minimum of ten years. This decision is not binding upon me and with all due respect, I am in no way persuaded by it.

 

[52]           Indeed, after taking into consideration the factors enumerated in section 745.4 of the Criminal Code, I find that the Crown has persuasively argued that a greater period of parole ineligibility would be appropriate. Accordingly, I assess that parole ineligibility to be fourteen years.
