[1]                The Accused, Ray Charles Nickerson, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder contrary to section 235(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. The alleged offences occurred in the late evening of April 2, 2017 in Chipman, Alberta.

[2]               The Defence has indicated that it will be advancing the defences of self defence and, in the alternative, provocation.

[3]               At approximately 00:22 on April 3, 2017, Mr. Nickerson was placed under arrest for murder and attempted murder. He was properly advised of his Charter rights and given a caution. He was then transported to the Fort Saskatchewan RCMP detachment.

[4]               Mr. Nickerson had an opportunity to speak with a lawyer and indicated that he was satisfied with the advice he had received. At 11:51 on April 3, Mr. Nickerson was advised of his change of jeopardy to two counts of murder. He was advised of his right to again contact a lawyer but he declined.

[5]               On April 3, 2017 at 12:33, Mr. Nickerson provided a voluntary, warned and cautioned statement to Sgt. Heidi Ravenhill of the RCMP Major Crimes Unit. The statement ended at 14:33 (Statement 1). I have ruled that the statement was voluntary.

[6]               On April 3, 2017, at 19:57, Mr. Nickerson provided a second voluntary, warned and cautioned statement to Sgt. Ravenhill. The statement ended at 21:28 (Statement 2). I have ruled that the statement was voluntary.

[7]               The Crown sought to have the statements ruled admissible for the purposes of cross-examination in the event that the Accused testifies.

[8]               The Defence has indicated that Mr. Nickerson intends to testify which will subject him to cross-examination by the Crown. The defence brings this “Edgar” application seeking to have the two statements given by Mr. Nickerson to the police admitted into evidence in their entirety on the basis that they are spontaneous exculpatory statements made shortly after his arrest and show his reaction when first confronted with the accusation of having committed murder.

[9]               The Crown opposes the application and argues that the requirements for admissibility of the statements under the Edgar test are not met in the circumstances of this case.
