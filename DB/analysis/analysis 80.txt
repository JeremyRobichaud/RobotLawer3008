[14]                       As I have said, the two accused were arrested at their residence just before midnight on 23rd February and taken to the R.C.M.P. detachment at Airdrie, as was Michael Kay, who was subsequently not charged with any offence. No statement by the accused Andrew Kay was introduced in evidence. As I have said, statements made by the accused Bowen were tendered by the Crown and I held them to be admissible against her, but they were not evidence against Andrew Kay. Nor is there any eyewitness identification of Andrew Kay as being the man who discharged the shotgun in Edmonton. I shall discuss shortly the evidence of identification of the man who stole the gasoline at the Budget Gas Bar.

[15]                       As I have also already said, the evidence against Andrew Kay is circumstantial. As trier of fact, where the evidence is circumstantial, as Sopinka J. said for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Morin, 17th November 1988 [now reported 1988 CanLII 8 (SCC), 66 C.R. (3d) 1 at 19 [Ont.]]:

… the law lays down only one basic requirement: during the process of deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the evidence as a whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.

[16]                       Sopinka J. stated that “it is unwise to attempt to elaborate on the basic requirement referred to above”, except for two exceptions:

1. “The jury should be told that the facts are not to be examined separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal standard.” That is, although there is a “requirement that each issue or element of the offence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt”, “individual items of evidence” need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

2. The second exception does not apply at all to the case before this court. It concerns issues of credibility between the evidence for the prosecution and the evidence for the defence. As there is here no testimony of witnesses for the defence, I need say no more about this exception.

[17]                       I now intend, therefore, to examine the circumstantial evidence and to discuss the weight of each such item of evidence, and then to decide whether the evidence as a whole establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the killer was Andrew Kay.

THE TRUCK

[18]                       I find that the truck that was found parked in the Sunridge Mall parking lot at 7:15 a.m. on 26th January had been stolen from Ian Orange n Red Deer on 24th January. Mr. Orange testified that the truck photographed was his truck and that his truck bore licence plate FWG 891, which was on the truck when found. His truck was a small 1/2-ton 1984 Ford four wheel drive pickup. It was the truck that Constable Kowalczyk stopped just before he was killed, as is shown by the finding of the spent shotgun shell near where the truck was found in the Sunridge Mall lot I am satisfied that only this accused would have operated the stolen truck on Sunday evening, 25th January. I accept the evidence of Michael Kay that a black pickup truck was at the residence of the accused persons from late Saturday to Sunday evening and that it left the vicinity of the residence when he heard two vehicles departing that evening; that his mother and Andrew Kay left at that point; that he never saw his mother drive a vehicle with a standard transmission; that the truck he saw in the newspaper after the murder looked the same except that it was dirtier in the picture; and that the truck in the picture had the same antenna on top.

[19]                       I do not have any difficulty in accepting Michael Kay’s testimony. It was given in a straightforward manner. Based on the evidence, there is no reason to suspect that his evidence is tainted by animosity toward his brother. Michael Kay’s youthful crimes, his use of drugs and his present life of panhandling do not cause me any concern as to the reliability of his testimony. One further point as to his credibility must be mentioned. In his examination in chief he stated that his brother Andrew had told him in January 1987 that he and his mother were going to do some armed robberies. When asked in cross-examination whether he had told Corporal MacIntyre on 3rd March 1987 that his mother had told him that, he said he could not remember discussing armed robberies with his mother or discussing the matter with Corporal MacIntyre. Yet it is clear that on that day he did tell Corporal MacIntyre that his mother had said to him that they were going to do armed robberies. This is, therefore, an inconsistency. No doubt it weakens his testimony on the issue of who told him what, but be that as it may, he does not appear to have told Corporal MacIntyre that it was only his mother who told him that, so what he told Corporal MacIntyre is not directly inconsistent with his mother having also told him that she and Andrew were going to do robberies. My assessment of Michael Kay’s credibility is not adversely affected by this inconsistency.

[20]                       Michael Kay’s evidence, as support for the proposition that it could only have been Andrew Kay that drove the truck that night, suffers from one particular defect; he had been away from home until Christmas 1987, and anyway he was not asked whether he knew if either his mother or his brother had ever had a standard transmission car or other standard transmission vehicle. That possibility was raised neither in examination in chief nor in cross-examination. The possibility that any such vehicle had been owned by either of them, and that the accused Bowen had driven it, is merely speculative.

[21]                       Consequently, the evidence of Michael Kay that he never saw his mother drive a standard transmission vehicle makes it more likely than not that when his mother’s Oldsmobile and the truck left the residence that Sunday evening, it was Andrew Kay who was driving the truck and it was Andrew Kay who drove it at all times until it was abandoned at the Sunridge Mall.

[22]                       The R.C.M.P. hair expert, Sylvain Lalonde, testified that the vacuumings which other evidence established came from the driver’s side of the truck contained a total of 17 human scalp hairs of which 2 were consistent with Andrew Kay’s scalp hairs.

[23]                       Another item of evidence that limits the possession of the truck to either Andrew Kay or Linda Bowen is the warranty card in the name of the truck’s owner, Ian Orange. It was found by Constable Veinot some time after 6:30 a.m. on 24th February 1987, largely hidden in the trunk of the Oldsmobile. Although Mr. O’Brien contends that the Crown has failed to prove by whom and when the trunk was first opened, and he contends that the Crown has failed to prove that no one could have had access to the Oldsmobile and planted the warranty card in the Oldsmobile, and he argues that it is possible that after the seizure of the Oldsmobile the card might have been planted in the trunk by someone, that is a fanciful suggestion. Why would some policeman go to such trouble to implicate the two accused in that way when a jacket and sunglasses belonging (as I find) to Mr. Orange had been found at the accused’s residence at the time of the arrests, and had been in his truck at the time it was stolen in Red Deer on 24th January?

[24]                       Was it the truck that was stolen from Mr. Orange that was stopped by Constable Kowalczyk just before he was killed? Mr. O’Brien points out that Robert Schmidt, the attendant at the Budget Gas Bar, gave a description of the truck whose male operator stole gas at about 11:45 p.m. on 25th January which did not match certain important characteristics of Mr. Orange’s truck. He paid no attention to the truck while gasoline was being pumped into the truck which was at pump 9 of the self-service gas bar. While that was going on he received a cash payment from another customer whom we know to have been Robert MacPherson, who then departed. Mr. Schmidt returned to his paperwork. When he realized that the truck at pump 9 was driving away, he ran out but he could not see, or at least he could not see well because the lights on the driveway were out. Indeed, he testified that he could not see at all. He says that he first saw the back of the truck when it was far along the driveway. Its lights were not on at that time. He testified that he saw whole letters on the back of the truck as it went along the driveway, and that he is almost certain that the letters formed the word “Toyota”. He testified also that he is pretty sure that he saw a roll bar in the back of the truck. Mr. Orange’s truck had the letters “Ford” on the back, and there was no roll bar. But Mr. Schmidt’s evidence as to what he saw when the truck was on the driveway is unreliable in view of his testimony that he could not see the truck at all when it was on the driveway.

[25]                       At the time when the truck was still at pump 9, Mr. Schmidt testified that the truck was a smaller truck, that it seemed higher off the ground than most trucks, and that it was fairly dirty – all of which description can be applied to Mr. Orange’s truck. But his description of the truck as reddish-maroon, which is how he described it when he telephoned the R.C.M.P., does not match the colour of Mr. Orange’s truck. He explained that the lights at the gas station change the apparent colour of vehicles. Moreover, he told the police that the truck had “balloon tires” and confirmed that fact at trial; yet Mr. Orange’s truck did not have such tires.

[131]                  The facts of the present case are far from those of the Reference. The court does not have before it a situation as in the Reference where the legislation would require imprisonment even in the absence of any moral blameworthiness; on the contrary, the offence here is murder, which means that there has been an intentional killing so that there is, even in the absence of premeditation and deliberateness, a grave element of blameworthiness. As for penalty, Parliament has decided, in effect, that for what it regards as less serious cases of murder (which it calls second degree murder) there must be a sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for at least 10 years (up to 25 years, as the sentencing judge so decides, pursuant to s. 671), and for several instances of what it regards as more serious cases of murder, which it calls first degree murder, there will be a sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years.

[132]                  I cannot say that Parliament, in the case of the murder of a police officer, by making mandatory a term of life imprisonment and a minimum period of 25 years without eligibility for parole, has chosen a sentence which shocks the conscience of the court, or which is so unreasonable or extravagant as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or which is totally disproportionate and therefore quite incompatible with any of the objectives of a penal system as adopted by Wilson J. Nor can I say that such a mandatory fixed sentence is not “fit” in the sense that it is not proportionate to the seriousness of the offence in general terms. Viewed as one of several situations in which the penalty for murder is assigned that combination of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years, which is a more severe punishment than is so in the case of convictions for other murder situations, I cannot say that the mandatory punishment is such as to make the public dissatisfied in the sense that murderers of police officers generally receive more punishment than they deserve or is such as to cause the public to lack confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system. I cannot say that the mandatory punishment for such murders is in general terms seriously misplaced on the scale of offences and punishments which reflects proportionality between the punishment and the offence.

[133]                  Given, as I have said, that apart from the imperatives of the Charter, it is within the domain of Parliament to decide as a matter of policy to prescribe a mandatory fixed or minimum sentence for a particular offence, s. 7 demands no more than that the fixing of such punishment, and the corresponding elimination of the power of the sentencing judge to take mitigating circumstances of the offence or the offender into account, not be grossly disproportionate to the objectives of a penal system that were adopted by Wilson J. Section 7 does not prevent Parliament from imposing a mandatory fixed punishment for a particular offence which possesses a particular characteristic stated in general terms – such as where the murder is planned and deliberate, or is for money, or is the murder of a police officer, or is a murder that occurs during the commission of certain specific serious offences of violence against the person.

[134]                  I conclude, therefore, that s. 7 is not violated.

[135]                  Before leaving the subject of s. 7, I shall make two further observations about its general function and its relationship to this case.

1. It is apparent from the judgment of Wilson J. in the Reference that constitutional limits on the punishments that can be prescribed, whether legislatively or judicially, for a particular offence, may be found in both s. 7 and s. 12 of the Charter. To some extent, the protection afforded by the two sections will overlap. There may, however, be situations in which the rationale of s. 7 will be operative but that of s. 12 will not, as in the case of the Reference itself where the imperative of s. 7 rendered the substantive offence of no force or effect because a mandatory sentence of imprisonment would follow automatically even when the offender was morally innocent.

2. The conclusion I have reached in this case, that within the limits of gross disproportionality Parliament may assign a mandatory fixed or minimum sentence to an offence, or to an offence which in the manner of its commission contains some special ingredient, is consistent with a fundamental distinction between the role of Parliament and that of the courts in criminal matters. It is, I think, so obvious in the late 20th century as to be beyond question, that, even were it not for the Charter, Parliament could not constitutionally adopt an Act that found an individual guilty of an offence or that he be punished for an act other than one that offended the rules of one of the Houses of Parliament. In other words, it would surely be unthinkable today that Parliament could enact a Bill of Attainder or a Bill of Pains and Penalties although a Bill of Attainder was enacted in England as late as 1745 and a Bill of Pains and Penalties as late as 1722: see Holdsworth, History of English Law (1938), vol. 11, p. 618. A Bill of Attainder or Act of Attainder was a legislative finding of guilt of treason or felony and enactment of punishment therefor, by exile or death. Parliamentary Acts inflicting milder punishments were entitled Bills of Pains and Penalties, and provided for the forfeiture of civil rights, the loss of property rights, a prohibition against holding office, and other similar penalties in the nature of a deprivation of existing rights. See annotation to Nixon v. Admin, of Gen. Services, entitled “Supreme Court’s Views as to What Constitutes a Bill of Attainder Prohibited by Federal Constitution”, by D.B. Levendusky, (1977) 53 L. Ed. 2d 1273; see also note, “The Bounds of Legislative Specification: A Suggested Approach to the Bill of Attainder Clause” (1962-63), 72 Yale L.J. 330. Both kinds of legislative enactment imposed punishment upon named individuals or upon easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishments on them without a trial in a court of law.

[136]                  In the United States of America, during the anti-Tory fervour of the Revolutionary era, all 13 colonies enacted Bills of Attainder and Bills of Pains and Penalties, but, as is said in the note just cited [p. 331], “In 1789, having grown wary of such legislative excesses, the framers [of the Constitution] – unanimously, and without debate – moved to insure that they would never recur” by including art. 1, s. 9, in the Constitution. It reads: “No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed”. That clause has been interpreted as referring also to Bills of Pains and Penalties.

[137]                  In England and in Canada, such methods of Parliamentary trial and punishment have passed into desuetude. As I have said, it may be assumed that, even apart from the Charter, such a method of finding guilt and imposing punishment would be generally regarded as beyond the power of Parliament in a country like Canada which has “a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom”: see Preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 (30 & 31 Vict., c. 3) (U.K.). Since the inclusion of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution of Canada in 1982, it would surely be a “principle of fundamental justice” within the sense of s. 7 of the Charter that all convictions and all punishments for an offence are to be decided by a court of law, not by Parliament or a legislature. By this is meant that the infliction of punishment upon a named individual or a readily ascertainable member of a group of persons cannot be imposed, as a matter of fundamental justice, by Parliamentary or legislative act. I have ventured into this branch of our legal history in order to make a point, which is that, while Parliament did once exercise such a power and its exercise today would be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice, it is very much not contrary to the principles of fundamental justice that Parliament may decide in general terms, not in reference to specific named or ascertainable persons, what conduct is to be a crime and what punishment is to be imposed, whether that punishment be a range of sentences within limits prescribed by Parliament or a fixed penalty for conduct with some specific characteristic or characteristics. The only constitutional limit to that legislative competence is to be found in some other principle of fundamental justice that will be recognized under s. 7, or in some right protected by another section of the Charter such as ss. 9, 12 and 15. If the limit is to be found in s. 7, the operative principle of fundamental justice must be one the scope and content of which is determined as being a basic tenet of our legal system, as lying in “the inherent domain of the judiciary as guardian of the justice system”, and as being an essential element of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in ” ‘the dignity and worth of the human person’ ” and upon “ ‘the rule of law’ ” (see Lamer J. in the Reference at p. 302). While s. 7 is to receive a liberal and generous interpretation, the limits of its scope and content are to be articulated having in mind the observations just mentioned. In my view, the conclusion I have reached, rejecting the contention of the defence that Parliament cannot deprive the sentencing court of the power to take into account the circumstances of the actual offence or of the offender, is consistent with the limits of s. 7 just referred to.

Do the same provisions of the Criminal Code violate s. 15 of the Charter?

[138]                  Section 15(1) of the Charter reads:

15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

[139]                  Mr. O’Brien has argued, in his written submission, that where an accused is convicted of murder that is first degree murder, irrespective of whether it is planned and deliberate, where the victim is a police officer, and the accused is then required by virtue of s. 669(a) to “be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence”, there are three reasons for which the legislation is inconsistent with s. 15.1 shall discuss each of them in turn:

[140]                  1. Mr. O’Brien argues that “the accused is denied the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law” in that he:

… will face a sentence of minimum life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for twenty-five years instead of the minimum sentence of life without parole for ten years, notwithstanding that the same mental elements for murder are found in both cases and notwithstanding that neither case involves planning or deliberation.

[141]                  He argues that there is an affront to the dignity of the accused as a human being when he must receive the same sentence as that of a murderer whose conduct is first degree murder because the murder was planned and deliberate for the moral culpability of the former is not as great as that of the latter.

[142]                  During the course of oral argument, Mr. O’Brien conceded that none of the grounds of discrimination that are enumerated in s. 15 apply to this situation. When asked what non-enumerated ground would apply, he invoked constitutional values found elsewhere in the Charter, specifically those in ss. 7, 9 and 12. Those values can bring s. 15 into play: see Cabre Explor. Ltd. v. Arndt, 1988 ABCA 212 (CanLII), 60 Alta. L.R. (2d) 172 at 181, [1988] 5 W.W.R. 289, 39 L.C.R. 212, 87 A.R. 149 (C.A.), per Kerans J.A. Kerans J.A. expressed the view that the test must reflect “some affirmation that the line of thought under review has gained acceptance in our society”; it is a test of “integrity” in justice, which may be met by “many different lines of thought”. Those lines of thought, he said, would include “invidious distinction based upon personal characteristics”, “the rule of detrimental irrationality”, “the rule that s. 15 protects the citizen from distinctions that do not respect other Charter values”, and perhaps “other ideas of fairness, justice or procedural due process”. With respect, I think that those very helpful observations are consistent with what I said in Kask v. Shimizu, 1986 CanLII 100 (AB QB), 44 Alta. L.R. (2d) 293 at 300-301, [1986] 4 W.W.R. 154, 28 D.L.R. (4th) 64, 69 A.R. 343 (Q.B.), that:

When we focus on some non-enumerated grounds of discrimination, the hallmark by which a statute or administrative conduct must be judged when it is alleged that it violates the rights of the individual to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination must be whether discrimination by the state on that ground would undermine the “essential” or “underlying” values of a free and democratic society.

(Although the actual decision in Kask v. Shimizu was overruled in Crothers v. Simpson Sears Ltd., 1988 ABCA 155 (CanLII), 59 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1, [1988] 4 W.W.R. 673, 86 A.R. 268 (sub nom. Singh v. Dura), the Court of Appeal did not comment adversely upon the general approach that had been taken in Kask v. Shimizu to the interpretation of s. 15. What the Court of Appeal did say in the Crothers case, at p. 18, as to the test of “equality before the law”, was that it required “a general examination of whether the statute is in pursuit of a valid (provincial) legislative objective”. This test, it seems, with respect, has itself to have been implicitly replaced by the more detailed approach outlined in Cabre Explor. Ltd. v. Arndt.)

[143]                  In the present case there is no issue of personal characteristics. As for “detrimental irrationality”, I can do no more than to repeat what I said in respect of the attack based on ss. 9 and 12. As for whether the distinction complained of fails to respect “other Charter values”, the argument fails because it amounts to no more than a restatement of the arguments already advanced by Mr. O’Brien in regard to ss. 7, 9 and 12, which I have held to be unpersuasive.

[144]                  2. Mr. O’Brien argues “the accused is denied the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law” in that he:

… loses the benefit of s. 671 of the Criminal Code which provides that the sentencing judge will consider, prior to sentencing on murder, the character of the offender, the nature of the offence, and the circumstances of the offence in determining the amount of imprisonment the accused must serve before being granted parole.

In other words, he argues, all murderers are persons similarly situated and must be treated similarly when it comes to their punishment, in the sense that all are to receive the same sentence of imprisonment for life and all are to have their period of ineligibility for parole set by the sentencing judge at between 10 and 25 years, having regard to the factors referred to in s. 671, i.e., “the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission”. The special characteristics identified in each paragraph of s. 214(4), Mr. O’Brien argues, do not result in the murderer being situated dissimilarly from other murderers. Therefore, he says, the distinctions created violate s. 15, and those characteristics, of which one example is that the victim is a police officer, can at best be a reason for saving the validity of the distinction by invoking s. 1 of the Charter.

[145]                  For the reasons given by Kerans J.A. in Cabre Explor. Ltd. v. Arndt, supra, at pp. 180-81, the “similarly situated” test is unsatisfactory and avoids facing up to the purpose of s. 1. Instead, as he said at p. 181, the test to be applied “should … attempt to identify the idea of equality underlying each s. 15 attack, and test it by a meaningful limiting rule”.

[146]                  The argument that all murderers are similarly situated and that therefore their punishment should involve the application of the same approach with the same range of criteria and the same range of possible deprivation of liberty cannot be accepted in the light of what Kerans J. A. has said in Cabre Explor. Ltd. v. Arndt.

[147]                  3. Mr. O’Brien argues that “the accused is denied the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law” in that he is denied the benefit of a principle of fundamental justice, namely, that before deprivation of liberty or security of the person, the court must consider circumstances of the particular offender and the particular offence. As far as I can tell, this is not really different from his second argument. It, too, fails.

[26]                       Moreover, he described the lone male occupant of the truck in terms that do not fit the accused Kay. He testified that he is pretty sure that the man was wearing a headband and a white greyish jacket and had a moustache and a stubbly face. When he gave a written statement to the police two hours after the event he stated that the man was in his late 40s or early 50s, but at the trial he stated that in making that description he had been misled by the effect of the lights.

[27]                       We know that the thief took 49.25 L of gasoline. We do not know whether he filled the gas tank. Corporal Broster testified as to how much gasoline was used by Mr. Orange’s truck when test run over a route from the Budget Gas Bar to the scene of the crime and then north to the first east-west road, east for a mile, south along the road near where licence plate FWG 891 was found, to the Sunridge Mall. The distance was 27 km. He then took the truck back over the same route, clocked at 27.1 km. He filled the gas tank to spill-over with 10.64 L, of which one half would be 5.32 L. In a later test he found that over the same route and back the amount of gasoline used was 13.32 L, one half of which would be 6.61 L.

[28]                       At the start of the first test, after 225 mL had been removed for another test, the amount of gas required to fill the truck to overflow had been 7.74 L. So, if this was the truck at the Budget Gas Bar, and if it was filled by the thief to overflow, we know that the amount of gas used by the truck if it travelled along the same route one way was 7.965 L. The tank might not have been filled by the thief to overflow, in which case less gasoline was used by the thief before the truck was abandoned. All that this evidence can tell us is that, if it was Mr. Orange’s truck that was at the Budget Gas Bar, the amount of gasoline consumed in the operation of the truck before it was abandoned at the Sunridge Mall does not indicate that in the intervening times it was driven over a much greater distance than the route followed in the test drives. This evidence is of no value in positively identifying Mr. Orange’s truck as the truck at the Budget Gas Bar.

[29]                       I turn now to the evidence of Robert MacPherson, who was the other customer at the Budget Gas Bar. At about 11:45 p.m. he arrived there and went to pumps close to the cashier’s office. At the pumps farthest away from the office he saw a vehicle which he faced as he put fuel in his car. When he left, he drove around the other vehicle. He testified that it was a small four wheel drive pickup truck, dark blue, which from its outline he believed to be a Japanese model. He did not read any insignia on it. He thought it was relatively clean, and that it was a relatively new model, in the mid-’80s. At the time he thought that he saw a light-coloured box in the back. The truck door was open and had a beige interior, as does Mr. Orange’s truck (see photo 58). At the truck there was a person whom he described as a Caucasian male, less than 30 years of age, with a medium to small build and a height about 5 feet 10 inches, brown hair, wearing a light top, blue jeans and tennis shoes. This description, except for the clothes, is like the accused as seen in the courtroom, and in the photographed identification parade on 25th February. He did not think that the man had facial hair, but he saw only the man’s side and back except when he turned around once, briefly. He was uncertain as to whether the man was wearing a baseball cap.

[30]                       Mr. MacPherson’s testimony was impressive. Whatever the explanation may be for the fact that he observed – and next day remembered – so much about the other customer and vehicle which were at the gas bar, I have no doubt that these were his observations, that the truck was black, not reddish-maroon, and that otherwise his description of the truck did not significantly diverge from a proper description of Mr. Orange’s truck.

[31]                       By coincidence, when Mr. MacPherson left the Gas Bar he drove west to the Deerfoot Trail (Highway 2), and turned northward along the highway on the west side of the airport. After he had passed to the north of the airport, the highway came within a short distance of what he described as a service road, parallel to the highway and to the east of it some 50 to 100 yards. This “service road” was in fact Highway 2A. He then observed two vehicles on that road, proceeding northward, one behind the other at a distance of 50 yards. There was a single flashing light on the southernmost of the two vehicles. The two vehicles then proceeded north “maybe” another half mile to a mile. Then dome lights came on, on the southernmost vehicle, which he realized was a police car because he could see a white door and insignia on it. As Mr. MacPherson passed them, he saw the brake lights go on on the northmost vehicle. This was after the police car had travelled close to a mile with the overhead lights on. It was 3/4 mile to 1 mile south of the next east-west road to the north – the road crossing the Balzac overpass. He testified that that vehicle was a small four wheel drive dark-coloured pickup truck and that when he first saw it with lights shining on it from a distance of two or three car lengths he thought that it was the same vehicle as the one he had seen at the gas station. When Mr. MacPherson reached the Balzac overpass he left Highway 2 and crossed the overpass. While doing so he looked back and saw the flashing light. This was about 12:05 to 12:10 a.m. He estimated he had by then been gone from the gas bar about five to ten minutes. We know from the test drive of Mr. Orange’s truck that the distance northward, past the east side of the airport to the point in the “service road” (otherwise known as Highway 2A) where Constable Kowalczyk’s body was found, was 11.8 km.

[32]                       While Mr. MacPherson’s testimony cannot identify definitely the truck which he saw stopping in front of the police car on the service road, his testimony, which I accept, makes it possible that was so. It cannot establish more than that. It does negate any possibility that the truck at that gas bar was clearly not the same as the truck on the service road.

[33]                       Thus, this evidence as to how the episode began does no more than suggest the Crown’s theory, but it falls short of proving, even on a preponderance of the evidence, that the truck and driver that left the Budget Gas Bar were the same as the truck and driver that were stopped by Constable Kowalczyk.

[34]                       In my view that is of no importance to the conclusion to which I am impelled by the remainder of the evidence.

[35]                       Constable Hazelwood testified that the licence number referred to by Constable Kowalczyk when he called to say that he was stopping a blue Ford truck was BNL 288. This was the number of two licence plates that were stolen some time earlier on 25th January from a similar truck parked at a residence in north-west Calgary. When Mr. Orange’s truck was found the next morning at Sunridge Mall, that was the number of the licence plate at the front of the truck. The other licence plate bearing that number was found by Constable Chambers that night in a field 25 yards from 36th Street, which is north-south about 1 mile east of Highway 2A. (Assuming that that plate was then removed from the truck which was being driven by the killer, and thrown into the field, the truck had gone northward from the scene of the crime 1.8 km to east-west Highway 566 (the Balzac Road), east to 36th Street then south 2.34 km to the point where the licence plate was found.)

THE BASEBALL CAP

[36]                       According to Iris Nunns, who lived in the house of the two accused from mid-September 1986 to 27th January 1987, Andrew Kay usually wore a baseball cap, navy blue or black in colour. She could not say if he had more than one. I accept her evidence.

[37]                       I accept the evidence of Michael Kay which was that Andrew Kay usually wore a black Quaker State baseball hat, that Andrew Kay had it when he, Michael, returned to his mother’s house in December 1986. He testified that Andrew wore it “all the time”, even in the house, but in cross-examination he stated that sometimes Andrew wore another baseball cap. He testified that there was no other baseball cap in the house, but in cross-examination he stated that there were other baseball caps, one of which he would borrow. Despite the inconsistencies in these aspects of his testimony, there is no reason to doubt his basic testimony that Andrew usually wore the “Quaker State” cap. I add that Michael Kay testified that a few days after the policeman was killed he asked his brother Andrew if he could borrow that baseball cap but that Andrew replied that he had lost it.

[38]                       There is no evidence as to how many Quaker State baseball caps there are in existence. The evidence that such a Quaker State cap was found at the feet of Constable Kowalczyk’s body would alone fall far short of proving that it was the accused Kay’s cap and that he had been at the scene.

[39]                       The probative value of the finding of the cap at the scene depends therefore upon the evidence of Sylvain Lalonde, a civilian member of the R.C.M.P., which must be scrutinized carefully. He is a hair and fibre examiner. The baseball cap found at the scene was delivered to him. From it he removed eleven human scalp hairs, to which I shall refer as the “baseball cap hairs”. He compared them with hairs removed from Andrew Kay’s scalp at the Airdrie Detachment in the early hours of 24th February. I shall refer to those human hairs as “Andrew Kay’s known scalp hairs”.

[40]                       He also received four bags of vacuumings from the truck in which he found 15 human hairs. These vacuumings had come from the seat on the driver’s side of the truck and the floor of that side of the truck. I shall refer to these hairs as the “truck hairs”. He found one truck hair from each vacuuming that was consistent with Andrew Kay’s known scalp hairs.

[41]                       Upon conducting his comparison of the 11 baseball cap hairs with Andrew Kay’s known scalp hairs, he found that 9 of the baseball cap hairs were consistent with those of Andrew Kay’s known scalp hairs, which were light-coloured hairs. He explained that it is only with hairs of a similar colour that such an expert makes a comparison. He explained that he would not reach an opinion of “consistency” unless at least one hair in the sample of known origin (here Andrew Kay’s known scalp hairs) showed the same range of characteristics along its length, in the same sequence, as in one of the hairs of unknown origin (here the baseball cap hairs). Mr. Lalonde explained his opinion of “consistency” as meaning that the possibility that the hair of an unknown source – in this case the baseball cap hairs – came from another person than the person who gave the hair sample whose source was known – in this case Andrew Kay – can never be excluded 100 per cent.

[42]                       He testified further that the probabilities that the hair came from a person other than Andrew Kay are less than 1 per cent, and subsequently he said “much less than one percent”. He based this opinion upon his experience and the literature in the field. Mr. Lalonde admitted that, unlike the science of fingerprint identification, the science of identification by hair comparison does not enable the expert examiner to make an absolute identification of the person who is the origin of the known hair sample as being the person whose hair is in question, i.e., here found on a baseball cap.

[43]                       He admitted that within Canada there may be hundreds, maybe thousands, of blonde persons who could produce hair standards similar to those found on the baseball cap. He could not state what the size of the group that could do so is.

[44]                       He gave the same opinion in regard to scalp hairs found on Andrew Kay’s trousers, his T-shirt and his jacket at the time of his arrest. Of the scalp hairs found on the clothes, five taken from the blue jeans were in his opinion consistent with Andrew Kay’s scalp hairs, five taken from the T-shirt were consistent with Andrew Kay’s scalp hairs, six taken from a jacket were consistent with Andrew Kay’s scalp hairs, and two taken from his shoes were consistent with Andrew Kay’s scalp hairs although neither of these was indistinguishable from any of the baseball cap scalp hairs. Of those hairs found on the clothes, five from the trousers, two from the T-shirt and three from the jacket were, in his opinion, indistinguishable from at least one hair on the cap, that is, they were, in his opinion, consistent with the hairs on the cap. Based on his experience, he described the chances of randomly chosen hairs matching each other as being “very small”, “incredibly remote” and less than 1 per cent.

[45]                       Thus, although statistics are not available as to the numbers of blonde Canadians, or of the number of blonde persons in the Calgary area, who could produce scalp hair samples that would include at least one hair that would be indistinguishable from the scalp hairs found on the baseball cap, the basis of the opinion of Mr. Lalonde as to the probabilities, i.e., his experience, remained unshaken on cross-examination and has not been answered by contrary expert evidence. I have no reason to treat his evidence as not deserving to have considerable weight attached to it. I do give it considerable weight as indicating that the hair on the baseball cap found at the victim’s feet was that of Andrew Kay, while of course I recognize that it alone is not in the category of conclusive forensic evidence of identification.

[46]                       He found moreover that the nine baseball cap hairs are distinguishable from the hair samples given to him which had come from the scalps of Linda Bowen and Michael Kay. This makes it even less likely that, if the hat was one that came from the residence of the accused persons, it was the accused Bowen, rather than the accused Kay, who was wearing it at the time of the murder.

[47]                       I am satisfied, indeed satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, by the combination of the evidence which I have referred to, that the baseball cap found at the scene of the crime was that of the accused Andrew Kay.

THE SHOTGUN

[48]                       The defence in argument has admitted that the Crown has proved that the shotgun seized upon the arrests belonged to Andrew Kay.

[49]                       Ronald Jaap, a salesman at Canadian Tire in Calgary, sold a Winchester Defender 12-gauge shotgun to Andrew Kay in December 1986. He also sold him ammunition. His identification of Andrew Kay is positive; not so that of Bowen as the older woman who accompanied him. The shotgun seized when the accused was arrested was the same make and model.

[50]                       Michael Kay testified that among the firearms that were kept in the bedroom shared by the two accused were a shotgun and a fake-45 handgun, that all the guns were Andrew’s, that the shotgun was (like the gun seized when the accused were arrested) brown and black with a Calgary Flames sticker on the butt which looked like the shotgun seized and that Andrew told him he had bought it at Canadian Tire, that the shells were red and some had the numeral “4” and some had “7” on them, that Andrew used the gun 10 or 12 times to fire at the fence at the farm, and that he never saw his mother shoot the shotgun.

[51]                       Upon his arrest, Andrew Kay warned the arresting officer that another policeman was handling “his” gun which he said was loaded.

[52]                       Three spent shotgun shells were found at the scene of the crime. Staff Sergeant Dickinson, an expert with the Firearms and Tool Marks Section of the R.C.M.P. Crime Lab, testified that he test-fired the shotgun that was seized and that comparisons showed that the three spent shells found at the scene of the crime had been fired from that gun and no other gun. I accept this evidence.

[53]                       There is thus no question but that the gun which Andrew Kay owned was the gun used in the murder of the victim. Mr. O’Brien contends, however, that there must be doubt as to whether it was Andrew Kay or Linda Bowen who fired the gun at the deceased. He points out that both had access to the gun, and that Michael Kay could not testify as to who actually carried the gun out of the house and away from the residence on the evening of 25th January.

[54]                       I agree that it is not proved by direct evidence whether it was Andrew Kay or Linda Bowen who carried away the shotgun that night, kept it in his possession and used it that night. However, the circumstantial evidence satisfies me that, as between Andrew Kay and Linda Bowen, or as between him and any other person, it was Andrew Kay who took the shotgun and used it that night. There is ample evidence to indicate that, as between the two of them, Andrew Kay and only Andrew Kay had previously used that gun and no evidence that Linda Bowen even knew how to use it. And it would be merely fanciful to give credence to the possibility that, having taken the shotgun that night, Andrew Kay lost it or that in some other way it came into the hands of some other person.

[55]                       The evidence that points to Andrew Kay as the person who fired the shotgun would alone be sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to convict him, but it is supported by the other evidence that links him to the truck that was found seven hours after the killing at the Sunridge Mall, and by the evidence that links him to the baseball cap found at the scene of the crime. In regard to the evidence as to each of those matters, it would not alone prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killer was Andrew Kay. However, the evidence as to each of those matters supports the evidence that points to him as the person who fired the shotgun. Even if the evidence that points to him as the person who fired the shotgun were not in itself proof of identity beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence as a whole establishes that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.

[56]                       The accused Kay is therefore guilty of murder. The Crown submits that the murder is first degree murder, on two grounds. First, the Crown says that it is first degree murder because “it is planned and deliberate”, those being the words found in s. 214(2) of the Code. Second, in the alternative, the Crown says that it is first degree murder because the victim was “a police officer, police constable … acting in the course of his duties”, those being words used in s. 214(4)(a) of the Code as constituting first degree murder “irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate …” As will be seen in subsequent discussion of Charter issues, the matter is of importance to the punishment that attaches to the crime; the penalty is more severe in the case of first degree murder than in the case of second degree murder.

[57]                       It is not disputed that, although the indictment alleges that the accused is guilty of first degree murder, in that the victim was a police officer acting in the course of his duties, that does not limit the Crown to asserting that that is the only basis upon which the court may determine that the murder is first degree murder.

[58]                       There is no question that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts fall within s. 214(4)(a), that is, that Special Constable Kowalczyk was a police officer acting in the course of his duties. If R. v. Shand, 1971 CanLII 1217 (MB CA), [1971] 3 W.W.R. 573, 3 C.C.C. (2d) 8 (Man. C.A.), is correct, then, for there to be first degree murder under s. 214(4)(a) it must be proved that the accused knew that the victim was a police officer. Assuming, despite the doubts cast upon that proposition in R. v. Munro (1983), 1983 CanLII 3542 (ON CA), 36 C.R. (3d) 193, 8 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (Ont. C.A.), that R. v. Shand states the law correctly, in the present case the evidence of Mr. MacPherson as to what he observed as he drove northward on Highway 2, and very similar evidence given by Richard Skytt, which I will not give in detail, as to what he observed as he drove north on Highway 2 that night, establishes that Special Constable Kowalczyk’s police car’s overhead light was flashing for some time before it stopped the truck, and he was in police uniform. It is clear beyond doubt that the killer knew that he was being stopped by a police officer acting in the course of his duties. The murder is therefore first degree murder on this ground.

[59]                       Is it also first degree murder as being “planned and deliberate”?

[60]                       The proper interpretation of the word “planned”, as used in this phrase, was stated as follows by Gale J. in R. v. Widdifield (1961), 6 Cr. L.Q. 152 at 153 (Ont. H.C.), as follows:

I think that in the Code “planned” is to be assigned, I think, its natural meaning of a calculated scheme or design which has been carefully thought out, and the nature and consequences of which have been considered and weighed. But that does not mean, of course, to say that the plan need be a complicated one. It may be a very simple one, and the simpler it is perhaps the easier it is to formulate.

The important element, it seems to me, so far as time is concerned, is the time involved in developing the plan, not the time between the development of the plan and the doing of the act. One can carefully prepare a plan and immediately it is prepared set out to do the planned act, or, alternatively, you can wait an appreciable time to do it once it has been formed.

[61]                       The first three sentences quoted were approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Reynolds (1978), 1978 CanLII 1269 (ON CA), 22 O.R. (2d) 352, 44 C.C.C. (2d) 129 at 137, per Martin J.A., and by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Smith (1980), 1979 CanLII 2233 (SK CA), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 381 at 387, 1 Sask. R. 213. In R. v. Smith, Culliton C.J.S. added:

I realize it is both difficult and unwise to attempt to give an exhaustive meaning to the word “planned”. It is a common word and to it should be attributed its meaning as understood in everyday life. Clearly, planning must not be confused with intention as the planning would only occur after the intent to murder had been formed. There must be some evidence the killing was the result of a scheme or design previously formulated or designed by the accused and the killing was the implementation of that scheme or design. It is obvious a murder committed on a sudden impulse and without prior consideration, even though the intent to kill is clearly proven, would not constitute a planned murder.

[62]                       The word “deliberate” was discussed by Gale J. in R. v. Widdifield as follows [at p. 153]:

As far as the word “deliberate” is concerned, I think that the Code means that it should also carry its natural meaning of “considered,” “not impulsive,” “slow in deciding,” “cautious,” implying that the accused must take time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of his intended action. That is what, as it seems to me, “deliberate” means.

[63]                       In his article “First Degree Murder” (1978), 21 Cr. L.Q. 82, Professor Alan W. Mewett wrote as follows about “the distinction between intending to kill and planning and deliberating to kill”. He said at p. 86:

One can, of course, deliberate whether to kill for a long time, and plan only very briefly, or deliberate briefly and plan for a long time but some planning and deliberation there must be and they must exist at some point before the killing takes place, for the deliberating is not deliberating whether to kill but deliberately deciding to kill.

One thing that seems to be clear is that the planning and deliberating cannot, as can intent, be formulated instantly preceding the killing – there must be time to plan and deliberate. But how much time may best be considered in relation to the second of the two problems – viz., that since planning and deliberating require, as Cartwright, J., pointed out in R. v. Mitchell, a thought process, how rational must this thought process be?

[64]                       Professor Mewett then discussed the effect upon the capacity to plan and deliberate of drunkenness, provocation, mental disturbance, none of which concern us in this case. In the course of that discussion, however, he made the following observation:

Planning and deliberating requires, to borrow an analogy in the issue of insanity, an appreciation of what is being planned, estimating it aright, perceiving the full force of the planning and the decision.

At p. 87, Professor Mewett stated:

It is not the length of time between the formulation of the plan and the killing that is significant so long as there is sufficient time for the accused rationally to plan and deliberately decide to kill. Equally clearly, the shorter the time, the more difficult it will be for the Crown to prove that the killing was preconceived and not impulsive.

[65]                       The only other authority to which I wish to refer, before proceeding to apply these principles to the facts, is R. v. Ruptash (1982), 1982 ABCA 165 (CanLII), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 182 at 183, 36 A.R. 346, in which the Alberta Court of Appeal held that “the deliberation required for murder in the first degree must occur before the act of murder commences”. In R. v. Ruptash the trial judge had held that the element of “deliberateness” was found in the ” ‘four to five minutes of constant pressure to cause death’“ by strangulation. The Court of Appeal held mat this was misdirection.

[66]                       Turning to the facts of the present case, Mr. Martin, for the Crown, argues that evidence that the killing was “planned” consists of Michael Kay’s evidence that the accused Andrew Kay told him that he was going to do armed robberies, that the accused Andrew Kay on Sunday evening, 25th January took with him the shotgun, ammunition, clothes, food and ammonia, and that he stole a truck in order to fool the police. Mr. Martin points to the fact that Mr. MacPherson testified that the overhead flashing lights on the police car came on a mile before the police car and truck stopped, so that, apart from the original planning, which must have contemplated the possibility of police involvement, once the accused knew that a police car was following him with its lights flashing, he knew that the policeman would stop him. While Mr. Martin did not say so, he might have added that it is likely that during that period of time the accused realized that one way or another, on being asked to produce his operator’s licence and vehicle registration and insurance documentation, he would be suspected of driving a stolen vehicle. The shotgun may have already been loaded, or the accused loaded it as he drove before coming to a stop.

[67]                       The general planning of the accused, as he set out that night, may have been to use a loaded shotgun in carrying out an armed robbery, and then in avoiding detection if possible. However, the evidence that is admissible against him does not justify a conclusion that he formulated a plan to kill any police officer or other person who attempted to intervene during a robbery or during flight. To use the words of Culliton C.J.S., the evidence does not constitute “some evidence the killing was the result of a scheme or design previously formulated or designed by the accused and the killing was the implementation of that scheme or design”.

[68]                       That being so, is proof of planning and deliberation found in the time period during which the accused knew he was about to be stopped by a policeman or policemen in the police car that was flashing its lights behind him, and in the evidence that glass was found on the road which tends to indicate that the driver’s window on the truck was still up when the first shotgun shell was discharged, and in the evidence that makes it clear that it was only after the policeman had emptied his revolver at the truck that the accused got out of the truck and fired one or more shots and certainly the fatal shot close to Constable Kowalczyk’s face?

[69]                       After considering this issue carefully, my conclusion is that, while the evidence clearly established that the accused intended to kill the deceased and the homicide was therefore murder, I have a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate. I am not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that it was “planned” in the sense that the killing was the product of a calculated scheme or design which had been carefully thought out, and the nature and consequences of which had been considered and weighed. Moreover, I have a reasonable doubt that the element of deliberateness existed in the sense of that word as used by Gale J.

[70]                       Thus it is upon the basis of s. 214(4)(a) that the murder is first degree murder, which necessitates detailed consideration of the issues which Mr. O’Brien has raised as to the penalty attached to first degree murder based on that ground, when measured against some of the constitutional imperatives found in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

ISSUES THAT ARISE UNDER THE CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS

[71]                       Mr. O’Brien, counsel for the accused, Andrew Kay, has raised a number of issues based on rights guaranteed by sections of the Charter.

[72]                       He began his oral submission on these issues with s. 7 and then proceeded to s. 15, s. 9 and s. 12. Mr. Martin, for the Crown, began with s. 12, and proceeded to s. 9, s. 15 and s. 7. For the intervenant, the Attorney General of Canada, Mr. Macfarlane began with s. 15, and proceeded to s. 7, s. 12 and s. 9.

[73]                       I intend to begin with s. 12, and then deal with s. 9, s. 7 and s. 15 in that order.
