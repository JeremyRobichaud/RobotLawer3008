[91]   I am haunted by the prospect that the accused committed these offences against her daughter and I am doubly haunted by that prospect given the accused is now raising another young child.  However, I am equally haunted by the prospect of convicting the accused on the evidence before me.  I conclude the Crown has failed to establish the accusedâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, I find the accused not guilty.  The charges in the Indictment are dismissed.
