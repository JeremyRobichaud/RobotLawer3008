III.       The elements of sexual assault



[42]           Whether or not in a spousal context, each of the elements of the offence of sexual assault that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt are the same. Here there is no issue as to the elements of identity, date, and place.



[43]           The Supreme Court of Canada in R v. Ewanchuk, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330 broke down the  offence of sexual assault into its constituent elements.

[44]           The actus reus of the offence of sexual assault is established by proof beyond reasonable doubt of three elements:  touching, the sexual nature of the touching, and the absence of consent. The physical contact between the accused and the complainant during the time frame of the indictment and the fact that it was sexual in nature have been established beyond a reasonable doubt on the testimony of the accused and the complainant.



[45]           It remains for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt as part of the actus reus that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity.



[46]           The mens rea of the offence of sexual assault is established by proof beyond reasonable doubt of two elements:  that the accused intended to touch the complainant and knew of, or was reckless of or wilfully blind to her lack of consent. That he intended to touch the complainant, i.e. that the touching was deliberate and not accidental, inadvertent or involuntary has been established beyond a reasonable doubt on the testimony of the accused and the complainant. It remains in this case for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt as part of the mens rea that W.A.T. knew of, or was reckless of or wilfully blind to the complainant’s lack of consent. An accused may challenge the Crown’s evidence of mens rea by asserting an honest but mistaken belief in consent, which amounts to a denial of mens rea.




[47]           Every person charged with a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent, unless and until the Crown has proved that person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt is not a far-fetched or frivolous doubt. It is not a doubt based on sympathy or prejudice. It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. It is a doubt that logically arises from the evidence or the lack of evidence. It is not enough to believe that an accused is probably or likely guilty. In those circumstances the accused must be acquitted as the Crown would have failed to prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is nearly impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty. The Crown is not required to do so.  However, proof beyond a reasonable doubt falls much closer to absolute certainty than to proof of probable guilt. If at the end of the case, after considering all of the evidence, the trier of fact is sure that the accused committed the offence charged, the accused should be found guilty since the trier of fact is satisfied of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the case, based on all of the evidence or the lack of evidence, the trier of fact is not sure that the accused committed the offence, an acquittal should be entered.



           Actus reus - the absence of consent



[48]           S. 273.1 of the Criminal Code defines consent as follows:

Meaning of consent

273.1  (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means,

for the purposes of s. 271, 272 and 273, the voluntary agreement of the

complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.



Where no consent obtained

(2)   No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273,

where



(a)       ...

(b)       ...

(c)       ...

                        (d)       the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement

to engage in the activity; or

(e)       the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity,

expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.



Subsection (2) not limiting

(3)   Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in

which no consent is obtained.



[49]           As Major J. noted in Ewanchuk at para. 26, the absence of consent is subjective and is solely determined by reference to the complainant’s subjective internal state of mind toward the touching at the time it occurred. He explained at paras. 29-30:



It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant’s words and

actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt


against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual

touching to take place. If, however, as occurred in this case, the trial

judge believes the complainant that she subjectively did not

consent, the Crown has discharged its obligation to prove the

absence of consent.



The complainant’s statement that she did not consent is a matter of

credibility to be weighed in light of all the evidence including any

ambiguous conduct. The question at this stage is purely one of

credibility, and whether the totality of the complainant’s conduct

is consistent with her claim of non-consent. The accused’s perception

of the complainant’s state of mind is not relevant. That perception only

arises when a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent is raised

in the mens rea stage of the inquiry.



[50]           Major J. emphasized at para. 31: “ ... the complainant either consented or not. There is no third option .... There is no defence of implied consent to sexual assault in Canadian law.”



[51]           Nor is the trier of fact entitled to engage in propensity reasoning and to simply reason that because the complainant consented to sexual activity with the accused at times before the incidents complained of she is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity which is the subject of the indictment.
