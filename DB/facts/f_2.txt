On arrival at the location, which comprised several apartment buildings that appear to share a common paved parking lot inside the footprint of the apartment buildings, the two police officers came upon the two victims of the shooting. A deceased female was inside a parked vehicle and a male lay motionless on the parking lot behind that vehicle face up.

[4]            Not knowing the shooter was still active and in an upstairs apartment window, upon exiting their marked police vehicle and in full uniform they, too, were shot and killed by a high-powered rifle wielded by the shooter. More shooting soon followed without anyone else being killed or wounded.
