Facts

 

[7]               Diebel and Quinn had met in September of 2000 while both were in the forensic psychiatric unit. Diebel had been remanded for a psychiatric assessment in connection with a charge for breaking and entering. Quinn was there to help her deal with her abuse of alcohol.

 

[8]               Diebel had presented to the forensic unit for a pre-trial assessment. He was eventually found fit to stand trial. The psychiatrists in the forensic unit made a diagnoses of Bipolar I Disorder, manic phase with psychotic features. Diebel went to trial on the charges. As a result of the evidence given before the Courts, Diebel was found not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder. He was then transferred to Alberta Hospital Edmonton for further psychiatric inpatient care.

 

[9]               In addition to the 2000 admission, Diebel had been admitted to the Fraser Valley Hospital on January 26, 2004 and to the Peter Lougheed Short Stay Acute Mental Health Unit on April 11, 2004.

 

[10]            Bipolar I Disorder is a mental illness characterized by periods of mania, hypomania and depression. The disorder is treatable but in not curable and does not follow a predictable cycle. Sometimes, the disorder will be in remission, at which times none of the symptoms of mania, hypomania or depression present themselves.

 


[11]            After Diebel and Quinn had been discharged from the facility, they kept in touch, and two years later in September of 2002 they entered into a relationship. Diebel was living with his mother and step-father in Cereal, Alberta but travelled to Calgary on a regular basis. Whilst in Calgary, Diebel stayed with Quinn in the Calgary home that she shared with and was owned by her father. When the murder occurred, Diebel was still living in Cereal, but he was frequently travelling to Calgary, during which time he stayed with Quinn.

 

[12]            From a very young age, Quinn had struggled with alcoholism. It was a common occurrence for her to engage in binge drinking and disappear for days at a time. Arden did not like her drinking, and usually when they were together she did not drink. Quinn’s drinking was a source of tension in their relationship and Diebel usually steered clear of her when she was drinking. In his own words: “I realized once she - starts drinking, you can’t deal with her or nothing and it’s better just to go on until she calls you and wants to sober up.”

 

[13]            The chronicle of events which occurred on September 15, and 16 of 2002 was presented to the Court in video and audio taped recordings and transcripts of confessions to the police made by Diebel on October 15, 2004. These recordings and statements were all filed as exhibits. Diebel’s account of the events is the only one available as to what occurred on the night in question.

 

[14]            At approximately 9:00 pm on September 15, 2002, Diebel telephoned Quinn from Cereal. At that point he had decided to go to Calgary. He was without money and needed gas for his truck. He stole $60.00 from his mother’s wallet and then “just hopped in the truck and took off.” At Hanna, he stopped to get gas and then purchased a six pack of beer. He then drove to a co-worker’s house where they drank together. His next stop was at another co-worker’s house to obtain and smoke some marijuana. He then continued on towards Calgary.

 

[15]            Just outside of Calgary, Diebel stopped at First Quality Industries, a company at which he had been previously employed, to pick up more beer. He had a key to the First Quality buildings and was aware that his former employer kept beer on the premises. While at First Quality, he telephoned Quinn who was at a bar drinking, and they decided to meet.

 

[16]            Diebel described in part the conversation that took place in his statement to police:

 

Ah, I just said where I was and that I’d be in town in like a half an hour or so. (She said) that she loved me. She did want to be with me. But she also knew that I didn’t like her drinking.

 

 Diebel then took a tool hanging on a wall of the shop. He recalled:

 

At this, this is probably umhm - - when I made up my mind, but that’s where I, ah, grabbed something that was on the wall.... You are going to think I’m a sick monster. You can’t understand, I had, I had quite a bit of alcohol... I had drinks before that too. I had drinks with friends, picked up a six-pack for the road and I had a joint I smoked and then I talked to her and she’s you know the evil Kelly and I just picked up a hammer on the wall.

 


...

 

I think it was red...It had a black grip and it had, the claw on the back...One of them was broken...Just an average hammer.

 

[17]            When questioned as to his feelings at this time he stated:

 

I don’t know. Just rage, I guess.... A lot of anger, a lot of hurt and just shock that it’s happened and that she’s doing this.... I don’t know if at that time, if I actually thought I would or not.

 

[18]            He put the hammer behind the seat of the truck and drove to Calgary.

 

[19]            Once in town, Diebel ran out of gas. He walked to a Mohawk gas station with a Jerry can for gas and used a pay telephone to again telephone Quinn. They decided to meet and later he met up with her in the parking lot of a school proximate to the Quinn residence. She was dropped off by a pick up truck which left the area immediately. The two embraced, and Quinn asked Diebel if he had some alcohol so that they could drink together. At first he said no, but when she indicated she wished he did, Diebel then indicated that he had some alcohol in the truck. His description of events is as follows:

 

With the drinking it was sometimes three or four days.... And, ah, I don’t know, just, and she just was kinda laughing, tossing her hair and just thinking it was funny and I was thinking, you know, look at what you are doing and, ah, she, when she is drinking, then she just doesn’t care. Everything is funny and...at first she seemed like maybe she would stop drinking and I asked her to go home and sober up and then she, she said, like, ‘well, no, I want to keep drinking’ or asked if I had alcohol or if I would get some....and we would drink together I guess was her idea.

 

I think I must have said ‘no’, that I didn’t have any alcohol, and then she said something to the effect that, ‘I wish, I wish you could get some’ or something like that and that’s when I told her ‘Yeah, I have some beer behind the seat’. That’s when I guess I made up my mind.... And then once we started, or I started accusing her and stuff like that, I, at some point I grabbed her and that’s, I was holding her hand, had the hammer up in the air and...and we went back and forth. I don’t really know, I was just basically accusing her of, umm, being a slut, and then it just happened.

 

She, umm, I don’t think she thought I would do it and I don’t know if I thought I was going to but then at the same time I was umm, I don’t know.

 


[20]            Another account of the incident comes from an intercepted telephone conversation between Diebel and his sister Valerie Joyce. In that conversation, he makes the following comments regarding September 15, 2004:

 

Not... I mean, I never planned that night...

 

And then later in the conversation:

 

And then she tells me she's gonna go, continue do it. Ya know, "Give me booze, do you have booze? 'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna go back and start having sex with these guys." That's what she t'... ya know, and then snap, crackle, pop. It's over.

 

[21]            According to his statement to police, he struck her approximately half a dozen times and put her body in the back of the truck. He then drove to a gas station where he fuelled up again. He made one more stop to purchase a coffee and use the bathroom. At a third stop, somewhere outside of Calgary, he checked on her in the back of the truck. His statement indicates that he thought he heard gurgling sounds coming from the body, so he hit her an additional 20-30 times. Diebel stated that he thought she might already be dead, but that also, he did not want her to suffer.

 

[22]            He then drove the truck out of town and disposed of her body, her clothing and personal effects.

 

Issue

 

[23]            The sole issue to be determined is whether or not it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate.
