II.        Facts

 


[2]               The Accused took his Jaguar motor vehicle to Sovereign Automotive Inc. for repairs. On January 31, 2003, he retrieved his vehicle from Sovereign on the understanding that he was to take the vehicle back the following week for additional repairs once certain parts were received. Despite making several appointments, he never did return with the vehicle.

 

[3]               Stuart Graham, the owner of Sovereign, registered a Garage Keepers’ Lien against the vehicle. On February 18, 2003, he advised the Accused that the lien had been registered and, on February 21, 2003, the Accused arrived at the Sovereign premises to discuss the lien.

 

[4]               Mr. Graham explained the process and his reason for registering the lien. In particular, he advised the Accused that he had to protect his interest in the amount still owing for the repairs. He indicated that he had a 21 day time limit within which to register the lien, followed by a six month deadline to collect the debt, which might involve repossessing the vehicle, if necessary.

 

[5]               Mr. Graham said that, at that point, the Accused “just flipped, lost his cool and was agitated and got bad tempered.” The Accused told Mr. Graham that the Jaguar was like his child and very special to him. He then said that “no one treated his car like that” and if anyone touched his car, “[he] would get even.” According to Mr. Graham, the Accused “went berserk, crazy.”

 

[6]               Mr. Graham was able to calm the Accused, who then left the office and went outside. When he returned a few minutes later, he was calm and collected. Mr. Graham repeated his explanation about the debt on the vehicle and the Accused “just went nuts again . . .”.

 

[7]               According to Mr. Graham, the Accused did not act in a rude or demeaning way during this incident. He described the Accused as being “very agitated as if this was part of other issues of that day . . .”. The Accused’s reference to his car as “his child” and his suggestion that he would “get even” with anyone who touched it caused Mr. Graham to fear a possible physical assault.

 

[8]               The Accused told Mr. Graham that he felt the repairs to the vehicle were worth only $200.00 and he threw that amount on the counter. Mr. Graham told the Accused that he would take that amount as a deposit and give the Accused a receipt if he would like one. Again, the Accused became agitated. After Mr. Graham advised that he would “take the legal route,” the Accused stormed out of the office and did not return.

 

[9]               Evidence in the trial established that the Jaguar was damaged by three individuals, including Raed Sanjad and Tyler Sanjad, on February 24, 2003. Raed was the victim of a murder on February 26, 2003 and Tyler the victim of an attempted murder on that same day.
