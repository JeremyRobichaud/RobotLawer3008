1.      Background

 

[13]            A total of three indictments have been brought against Mr. Giroux. The indictment which Mr. Giroux is facing today, the day set for the opening of a jury trial, is a six count indictment - subsequently referred to as a combined indictment - which reads as follows:

 

1.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully cause the death of Derek Paskimin, thereby committing second degree murder, contrary to section 235(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

2.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully have in his possession a weapon, to wit: a knife for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

3.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a lit cigarette or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

4.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a telephone or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

5.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a knife or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.


6.         That he, on or about the 20th day of August, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully and wilfully obstruct Cst. Chomchuk #1873, a Peace Officer, in the execution of his duty, contrary to section 129(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

[14]            The indictment which was taken out first in time is a two count - murder - indictment, which contains the following 2 charges:

 

1.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully cause the death of Derek Paskimin, thereby committing second degree murder, contrary to section 235(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

2.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully have in his possession a weapon to wit: a knife for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

[15]            The indictment which was taken out second in time is a 5 count - assault - indictment.

 

1.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a lit cigarette or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

2.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a telephone or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

3.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did, in committing an assault upon Mandy Hardstaff, carry, use or threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a knife or an imitation thereof, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

4.         That he, on or about the 10th day of January, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully assault Mandy Hardstaff, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

 

5.         That he, on or about the 10th day of August, 2000, at or near Edmonton, Alberta, did unlawfully and wilfully obstruct Cst. Chomchuk #1873, a Peace officer, in the execution of his duty, contrary to section 129(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.


[16]            The Crown’s position is that the murder charges arise out of an incident which occurred at around 12:30 am. on January 10, 2000 at the International Hotel in downtown Edmonton.  The Crown indicates that it will lead evidence to the effect that the accused and the deceased were observed arguing in the bar of the hotel when they were told to “take it outside”.  A short time later, Mr. Paskimin was found on the sidewalk outside the hotel; he had been stabbed several times.  One stab wound had virtually severed his aorta.

 

[17]            The position of the Crown is that the assault charges initially found in the second indictment arose out of contact between the accused and Mandy Hardstaff, his former common law wife’s 17 year old sister, during a two or three hour period which began approximately one hour after the alleged murder. Approximately one hour after the alleged murder, the accused returned to his common law wife’s apartment; Ms. Hardstaff was baby-sitting the accused’s 4 year old daughter on January 9-10, 2000. During the course of the few hours that he spent with her, Mr. Giroux allegedly threw a lit cigarette at her, which cigarette burned her leg through the polyester pants that she was wearing and also threw a knife at her, which landed some distance from her (the knife is alleged to be a different knife than the one allegedly used in the stabbing of Mr. Paskimin).  He is also alleged to have threatened to hit her with a telephone receiver. The prosecutor states that there is a sufficient temporal nexus between these events and the events of the alleged murder to be heard together; in particular, the prosecutor states that the jury will hear all of the evidence of what the accused did after the “murder” as part of the narrative of events of the crime. The prosecutor also notes that the court will certainly give to the jury an instruction that even if the jury finds the accused guilty on counts 3, 4, 5, and 6, that does not make him guilty of murder.

 

[18]            The obstruction charges arose out of the attempt of the police to identify Mr. Giroux as part of an arrest on August 20, 2000 on charges different from all of the matters set out in all of the indictments. Indeed, the matters on which Mr. Giroux was arrested on August 20 were never proceeded with. The obstruction was, allegedly, Mr. Giroux’s giving of a false name to the police officer who arrested him. The Crown states that it has the right to put before the jury evidence about the way the accused was taken into custody. Moreover, the prosecutor states that he does not propose to inform the jury that, on August 20, 2000, the accused was arrested on allegations of having broken into a motor vehicle

 

[19]            Mr. Giroux concedes that some of the events which occurred between Mandy Hardstaff and himself may be sufficiently probative of the “murder” that the jury is entitled to hear evidence about them. For example, he notes that it is the Crown’s position that:

 

  -        when he arrived at the apartment, Mr. Giroux asked Mandy Hardstaff to wash off a bloody knife which he gave to her, and

 

  -        he made some statements to Mandy Hardstaff which constituted a confession of murder.

 


[20]            He indicates that all of the evidence led by the Crown which tends to show him as a person of bad character must be weighed according to whether it is more prejudicial than probative, but that the existence of charges and of evidence which would necessarily be led in in support of those charges would, inevitably and pointlessly, be generally prejudicial to him. Moreover, Mr. Giroux argues that all of the post-offence conduct which the Crown will apply to introduce will have to be vetted according to the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada in decisions such as Arcangioli.

 

[21]            Mr. Giroux states that the events of August 20, 2000 cannot be explained without reference to the circumstances that directly led to his arrest on that day, and that the disclosure of those events to the jury would be prejudicial to him and not at all probative of the charge of murder.

 

[22]            Through his lawyer, Mr. Giroux has informed the court of his settled intention to testify on the assault charges relating to Mandy Hardstaff.

 

[23]            Mr. Giroux’s lawyer acknowledges that, when he was first retained by Mr. Giroux, there was a discussion between himself and the prosecutor in which the prosecutor informed defence counsel of the prosecution intention to amalgamate the murder indictment and the assault indictment into the combined indictment. The defence did not object to the joinder at that time. Defence counsel states that his position has changed after full consideration of all the issues; this change of intention was made known to the prosecutor some time prior to trial.

 

[24]            Mr. Giroux concedes that count #2, dealing with possession of a weapon, arises out of the same transaction as the murder charge, and must be tried on the same indictment.

 

 

2.      General principles of severance where murder is charged

 

[25]            The overall purpose of the rules relating to severance is, of course, to advance the interests of justice. Those interests are grounded in fairness, both for the accused and for the community.

 

(i)      Principles relating to all severance applications

 

[26]            There is no dispute between the parties concerning the general principles of severance; they both accept Ewaschuk J.’s outline of the outline of factors which the trial court must consider on this application and which include:

 

  -        the factual and legal nexus of the charges;

 

  -        any general prejudice to the accused;

 


  -        the effect on the accused’s ability to testify;

 

  -        whether the joinder will lead to undue complexity;

 

  -        whether severance will lead to a multiplicity of hearings.

 

(ii)      Principles relating to severance applications where one count is murder

 

[27]            In this case, in addition to the general principles that apply to all severance applications, the court must also consider the specific principles that apply when murder is charged. As was mentioned by Mr. Giroux, until relatively recently, the prosecution was not entitled to join other charges to a count of murder. From 1898 to 1991, section 589 of the Code read as follows:

 

No count that charges an offence other than murder shall be joined in an indictment to a count that charges murder.

 

[28]            In 1991, that section was amended to read as follows:

 

No count that charges an indictable offence other than murder shall be joined in an indictment to a count that charges murder unless

(a) the count that charges the offence other than murder arises out of the same transaction as a count that charges murder; or

(b) the accused signifies consent to the joinder of the counts.

 

[29]            A history of the modification of the section is set out in the article by Prof. MacDougall and in the Beausoleil decision.

 

[30]            Therefore, when murder is charged and severance of the non-murder counts is requested, the court make two inquiries. First, do the additional counts meet the test that Parliament imposed, which is that the additional charges must arise out of the “same transaction”?  Second, if the additional charges arise out of the same transaction, has the proponent of severance established that severance is required because of general principles relating to severance.  The court therefore embarks on those two inquiries.

 

 

3.      Do all the counts arise “out of the same transaction”?

 


[31]            In comparison with the law’s opaque expression “factual and legal nexus”, Parliament’s language is simple, plain and robust “out of the same transaction”.  Most Canadians would probably interpret “out of the same transaction” to refer to the type of situation where an accused kills a teller during a robbery, or kills a girl during a sexual assault.  It may be, however, that the expression “out of the same transaction” has a broader meaning than may be apparent.

 

[32]            The expression chosen by Parliament has not received very much judicial consideration. Moldaver J., as he then was, cited with approval the following comments of Mr. Justice Sachs of the English Court of Appeal on the issue of what constitutes the “same transaction” as that expression is used in s. 589 of the Code:

 

In my opinion, when considering the definition of "transaction" in relation to the conduct of co‑accused, the thoughts expressed by Mr. Justice Sachs, speaking on behalf of the English Court of Appeal in the case of R. v. Assim (1966), 50 Cr. App. A. 224 are apposite. At p. 236, his Lordship stated:

 

As a general rule it is, of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on  charges of committing individual offences that have  nothing to do with each other, than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of  counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together. Such a rule, of course, includes cases where there is evidence that several offenders acted in  concert, but it is not limited to such cases.

 

Again, while the court has in mind the classes of case that have been particularly the subject of  discussion before it, such as incidents which, irrespective of there appearing a joint charge in the indictment, are contemporaneous (as where there has been something in the nature of an affray), or  successive (as in protection racket cases), or  linked in a similar manner (as where two persons individually in the course of the same trial commit perjury as regards the same or a closely connected fact), the court does not intend the operation of the rule to be restricted so as to apply only to such cases as have been discussed before it.

(Emphasis added).

 

[33]            Moldaver J. then continued in his own voice:

 

Disposition of Issue Two

 


In the case at bar, I am satisfied that the charges against Constable Longpre do arise out of the same transaction as the charge of second degree murder against Constable Melaragni. Although the offences alleged against each are clearly different, they arise out of the identical set of circumstances and they are closely related in both time and space. As well, the alleged victim is identical.

 

[34]            A consideration of this decision leads me to 3 observations. First, this case is very different from Melaragni; although the offences charges in counts 3, 4, and 5 are closely related in time to the murder charge, they do not arise out of the identical set of circumstances as the alleged murder and the victim is not identical. In addition, the obstruction charge is not closely related in time to the murder charge.

 

[35]            Second, although English criminal authorities are always of interest, so far as I am aware, the practice Rules in England have, for a considerable time, been different from the provisions of s. 589 of the Code. In particular, I note that Ewaschuk J. mentions in his text that Rule 9 of the 1971 British Indictments Rules provides that:

 

Charges for any offences . . . may be joined in the same indictment if those charges are founded on the same facts, or form or are part of a series of offences of the same or similar character.

 

[36]            On its face, therefore, the English rule is broader than s. 589 of the Code. While there is much to recommend the English Rule, the Canadian Parliament has established a different rule and Canadian courts, and Canadian prosecutors, are bound by the Canadian statute.

 

[37]            Third, Parliament’s language in s. 589 must be interpreted not only in a formal way, by parsing the words in the section, but in the broader context of the change which the current section brought to what had been a settled aspect of Canadian criminal law for 100 years. Parliament obviously wanted to remedy the problem which arose where a murder charge arose out of circumstances which may also have constituted other offences. In Beausoleil, Marchand J. put it this way:

 

[para10]     When Bill C‑54 which creates the present Section 589 was presented to the House of Commons, the parliamentary debates indicate that the proposed amendment to Section 589 was intended to deal with precisely the type of circumstances which was presented to the Supreme Court of Canada in Regina v. Vaillancourt, (1987)  1987 CanLII 2 (SCC), 39 C.C.C. (3d), 118, where the court had to deal with a situation of a murder charge which had arisen during the course of a robbery.

 

[para11]     When the Bill was given a second reading, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada explained the rationale of the amendment to Section 589 as follows:

 


The unfortunate fact remains, however, that there are a significant number of cases of murder each year in which a victim is stabbed or shot or beaten to death during the  course of the commission of another serious crime such as  sexual assault, robbery or break and enter ... The amendment to section 589 will provide that all offences arising out of the same incident may be tried together. As a result, the fact finding process will be much improved and justice will be better served since the possibility of delays will be greatly diminished.

 

[para12]     A similar rationale was articulated in the justice communique when the Bill finally received royal assent, as follows:

 

The new law (Bill C‑54) does away with the current practice of having a separate trial for persons accused of murder and other offences committed at the same time as murder. Under the new legislation, charges for other  indictable offences, such as robbery and sexual assault, would be dealt with at the same trial.

 

[38]            In summary on this point, having in mind Parliament’s apparent objective and clear language in amending s. 589 in limiting other charges to be joined to a charge of murder, I have concluded that the subject matter of counts 3, 4, 5, and 6 does not arise “out of the same transaction” as the transaction which led to the murder charges. Therefore, those counts cannot be tried with the murder count.

 

 

4.      Is there a factual and legal nexus amongst all the counts?

 

[39]            There is no factual or legal nexus amongst all the counts.

 

[40]            There is a temporal nexus between counts 3, 4, and 5 and counts 1 and 2, but the fact that the allegations arose relatively shortly after the alleged murder events does not create either a factual or a legal nexus. There is not even a temporal nexus between count 6 and the alleged murder events.

 

[41]            The events of the assault charges are not at all probative of murder; nor are the events of the obstruction charge. The prosecutor himself demonstrated this when he acknowledged that, at the least, the court would have to give an instruction to the jury to the effect that even if the jury found Mr. Giroux guilty on each of counts 3, 4, 5, and 6, that would not mean that they find Mr. Giroux guilty of murder. Indeed, the evidence on those counts cannot be used in any way to advance the charge of murder.

 

 

5.      Does the joinder of the existing counts cause the accused general prejudice?

 

[42]            The joinder of the existing counts would cause Mr. Giroux general prejudice.


 

[43]            We start the analysis of this factor from the position that no evidence can be led at trial which is not relevant.  Therefore, even if we start from the proposition that evidence of everything which occurred after the “murder” is relevant, evidence of matters will not be allowed before the trier of fact if the evidence is more prejudicial than probative. Evidence will not be allowed in just because it forms part of the narrative or just because it shows how an accused came to be in custody.

 

[44]            Is the evidence of Mr. Giroux’s conduct with his sister-in-law prejudicial? Of course it is.  The Crown’s own theory is that it shows Mr. Giroux as the kind of man who assaults a young relative.  The danger of allowing such evidence before the jury is that the jury might take Mr. Giroux’s propensity for violent behaviour into account in determining whether he committed the alleged murder.

 

 

6.      Does the joinder of the existing counts negatively affect the accused’s ability to testify?

 

[45]            The continued joinder of the counts would unnecessarily damage Mr. Giroux’s right to silence.

 

[46]            I accept the accused’s assertion that, at this moment, he intends to testify on the charges relating to assault, but he does not intend to testify on the murder charge.

 

[47]            We know that there are many reasons why an accused would choose not to testify. One is simply that he doesn’t have to and may not see the need to. Another is that he may not have a good memory of specific events. Another may be that he has a criminal record and he is concerned that knowledge of his record will be taken into account against him by the trier of fact, despite the law against that. There are many other reasons why an accused might wish to testify in relation to some matters and not in relation to others.

 

[48]            As the Supreme Court of Canada held in Noble, the right to silence is an important right in our society. It must be protected. It can only be protected here by severance of the counts.

 

 

7.      Does the existing joinder of counts result in undue complexity for a jury trial?

 

[49]            There is no undue complexity here.

 

[50]            The mere fact that a judge might have to charge a jury on a total of six counts, or even that a judge might have to charge a jury on the six counts set out in this indictment, does not constitute an undue complexity.


 

[51]            Contemporary jury practice suggests that: the jury will be provided with a copy of the judge’s charge; adequate pauses will be taken during the course of the charge; and the jury will be given adequate time to deliberate. All of these techniques and processes assist the jury especially in complex matters.

 

 

8.      Does the existing joinder of counts achieve our desire to avoid a multiplicity of hearings?

 

[52]            Here, the general objective of avoiding a multiplicity of trials must give way to the need to achieve fairness in relation to the murder counts.

 

[53]            In dealing with the notion of multiplicity of hearings, it is well to remember, as the House of Lords indicated in Christou that the court should consider the effect of two or more trials on the accused, and his family, on the victim and his family, and on pre-trial publicity for any subsequent trials.

 

[54]            These are important factors which might even be decisive factors if all other factors were equal. However, these are not the most important factors to consider. For example, if severance were required to achieve fairness for the accused but two trials would be twice as hard on the victim’s family, the court would have to be guided by the result that would achieve  fairness.
