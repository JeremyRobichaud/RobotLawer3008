The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his three- year-old son by grabbing his genitals. He appealed, arguing that he grabbed the child's genitals as a disciplinary response to the child having engaged in similar activity with others, so that the act, while it amounted to an assault, did not constitute a sexual assault.
