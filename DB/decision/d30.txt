After considering the law and the evidence in this case, I conclude as follows:

a)       I am left in some doubt about the Crown’s evidence of the assault and skeptical about how long it took for E.C.’s claim of assault to come out;

b)      I do not entirely believe the evidence of the Defendant, but I am left in reasonable doubt by it.

 

           

[13]                       Accordingly I find the Defendant not guilty.
