[39]                       In the particular circumstances of this appeal we are of the view that the charge would have been easier for the jury to follow and apply if the trial judge had first dealt with the issue of rape as a crime of specific intent.

[40]                       The judge would first instruct the jury as to the ingredients of rape, that is, sexual intercourse with a woman, not his wife, without her consent or consent obtained by threat, the jury, having to be satisfied in the light of all the evidence, including the evidence of drunkenness, beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused had formed the intent to do those acts and that the accused knew he did not have the victim’s consent.

[41]                       If the Crown so satisfied the jury that rape had taken place, the next question of which they must be satisfied is that the death was caused by the accused while committing rape. If the answers to these questions were in the affirmative, it would then be murder in the first degree if the injury which caused death was done to facilitate the rape or to facilitate flight thereafter or alternatively, if the accused intended to kill the deceased or intended to do her bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

[42]                       The jury should then be told that if they were not satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that first degree murder had taken place the issue then would be whether the accused was guilty of murder in the second degree under Section 212, that is whether the accused intended to kill the deceased or intended to commit bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. If they were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt the verdict would be murder in the second degree.

[43]                       If the jury is not satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of murder in either the first or second degree, it then must consider whether he was guilty of manslaughter.

[44]                       If the jury is satisfied that the accused caused bodily harm or wilfully stopped her breath and death ensued as a result thereof, then drunkenness is not a defence to manslaughter. D.P.P. v. Majewski (1976) 2 All E.R. at 142; R. v. Lipman (1969) 3 All E.R. at 410. The jury need only consider whether the bodily harm or stopping of her breath was accidental. An accidental stopping of her breath would occur when the force that caused her death was applied accidentally. Here a distinction must be drawn between force accidentally applied, which is not an unlawful act, from force applied intentionally. If they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the bodily harm or stopping of her breath was not accidental, they should find him guilty of manslaughter.

[45]                       Lastly, if the jury found or were in doubt that the bodily harm or stopping of breath was accidental, they should acquit.

[46]                       We think that the effect of the latter part of the judge’s charge may well have led the jury to believe that manslaughter was not open to them and if they did not find him guilty of first degree murder, they should find him guilty of second degree murder. This was not intended by the trial judge. He was making a distinction merely between first and second degree murder, but at the end of the very lengthy charge, we are fearful that this may well not have been clear to the jury.

[47]                       On this ground also we are also of the opinion that the conviction should be quashed.

[48]                       For the reasons given there must be a new trial. The question arises as to whether there should be a new trial on the charge of first degree murder or only on the charge of second degree murder which was the verdict of the jury. Counsel for the Crown has pointed out that the Crown has not appealed from the verdict of second degree murder and joins with the defence in making the submission that it is not open to this Court to direct a new trial on the charge of first degree murder.
