Discussion of the Evidence

 

[34]            Deciding whether Diebel’s actions were planned and deliberate demands that close attention is paid to the evidence and the interpretation by the experts as to what can and cannot be concluded regarding Diebel’s mental state on the basis of that evidence.

 

[35]            The Court heard evidence from Jana Diebel, the accused’s sister in law, from Diebel himself in the form of taped statements made to the police and in the form of RCMP intercepts of telephone conversations between Diebel and his sisters. Two psychiatric professionals also gave evidence and expressed opinions regarding what can be concluded from these sources about Diebel’s mental state at the time of the murder.

 

[36]            Jana Diebel, testified as to her familiarity with Diebel, and the time she spent with him on September 12, 2002, three days prior to the murder. They had visited a hardware store together to buy supplies. She described him as unusually talkative, his speech was rapid, and he continually jumped from topic to topic, never finishing one thought before starting on the next. Several times he called her “Kelly” but never corrected himself as he had already raced on to the next topic. His breathing was rapid, his face was flushed and he indicated that he had not been sleeping very much, and was drinking lots of coffee. He was also spending money in an irrational, reckless way. It was clear to Jana that he could not really afford to make the purchases he made.

 

[37]            According to Jana, Diebel's behaviour on September 12, was markedly different from his behaviour in the preceding months, during which time she described him as withdrawn and depressed. She also testified that she had observed similar, but stranger behaviour from Diebel in 2000, shortly before he was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment for his disorder.

 


[38]            Dr. George Peter Duska, is a forensic psychiatric specialist and was qualified as an expert. He testified as a defence witness. He was the treating psychiatrist assigned to Diebel in October of 2004, shortly after Diebel's arrest. He had also reviewed the reports from Diebel's previous visits to psychiatric facilities in 2000 and January and April of 2004. Dr. Duska sat in the courtroom and heard Jana Diebel's testimony. He also listened to recordings of the interviews between Diebel and the police and transcripts of the telephone intercepts.

 

[39]            Dr. Duska described the behaviours which would be displayed by a person suffering from Bipolar I Disorder while in a manic or hypomanic state. These behaviours are pressured speech, lack of sleep, increased energy, disorganized behaviour, racing thoughts, distractability and impulsivity. He also mentioned reckless behaviour such as irresponsible spending and pursuit of pleasure seeking activities, such as substance abuse, promiscuity or risk taking. I understand his evidence to be that the main difference between mania and hypomania is that during a manic episode, these symptoms persist for over one week, whereas during a hypomanic episode, the symptoms may be less pronounced and last between four and seven days.

 

[40]            Dr. Duska describes impulsivity as a flight of ideas, of jumping from one thought to the other without really considering what will be done next. After reviewing the statements made by Diebel to the police and the intercepts of phone calls between Diebel and his family, Dr. Duska opined that many of Diebel's comments and descriptions of events were strongly suggestive of impulsivity and that accordingly, the act of killing Quinn may not have been thought out before it was committed.

 

[41]            Based upon his knowledge of Diebel, Diebel's psychiatric history and the disorder from which he suffered, Dr. Duska concluded that he could not say for certain that Diebel was in a manic or hypomanic state at the time of the murder. However, he indicated that the information provided to him constituted strong evidence that Diebel may have been suffering from mania or hypomania on September 15, 2002. Dr. Duska explained that the evidence was such that he certainly could not rule out the possibility.

 

[42]            Upon cross examination, Dr. Duska was asked about Diebel’s decision to pick up the hammer at First Quality Industries. Dr. Duska explained that the act of picking up a hammer was not necessarily the act of selecting and obtaining a weapon. At that time the hammer was not necessarily thought of as the weapon it eventually turned out to be. In the context, he indicated that the act of picking up the hammer be interpreted as just impulsive act

 

[43]            The thrust of the defence therefore is that there is evidence to suggest that Diebel could have been acting in a state of hypomania, and that his behaviour is strongly suggestive of impulsivity, which is characterized by a lack of forethought prior to acting. The evidence brought forward is consistent as between the observations of Jana Diebel, the statements made by Diebel in the police intercepts and the statements made directly to the police.

 

[44]            In order to satisfy the Court that the murder was planned and deliberate, the Crown must deal with the evidence about Diebel’s impulsive behaviour.

 


[45]            The Crown called Dr. Kenneth Hashman in rebuttal to the testimony of Dr. Duska. Dr. Hashman is also a psychiatrist and had the benefit of reviewing the same evidence as Dr. Duska; however, whereas Dr. Duska sat in court and heard some of the evidence personally, Dr. Hashman merely reviewed transcripts of the proceedings. As Diebel’s treating psychiatrist after the arrest in 2004, Dr. Duska had spent time personally examining Diebel. Another difference is the format in which each reviewed Diebel’s statement to police. Dr. Duska reviewed a transcript whereas Dr. Hashman viewed the video tape itself. Neither of the doctors had observed Diebel while he was in a manic, hypomanic or depressive state.

 

[46]            Dr. Hashman testified that mild hypomania would not affect an individual's capacity to plan or deliberate, and that based upon the hypothetical statement of facts provided by the Crown, he determined that Diebel had been acting in a logical and coherent manner.

 

[47]            On cross examination however, Dr. Hashman agreed that if he believed Jana Diebel and the statements of Diebel, there might be some suggestion that Diebel was hypomanic at the time of the offence. Dr. Hashman was also asked to comment on whether or not it was possible that Diebel's behaviour in the last brief moments leading up to when he first struck Quinn could be characterized as impulsive. He went to great efforts to avoid agreeing with this proposition, and preferred instead to use the term ambivalence. According to Dr. Hashman, ambivalence can be described as mixed feelings. When questioned further, Dr. Hashman elaborated on his opinion of the ambivalence of Diebel by hypothesizing that Diebel "doesn't know what to do with the situation with this woman".

 

[48]             I am influenced by the evidence of both Dr. Duska and Dr. Hashman as to Diebel’s state of mind immediately prior to the killing, and whether or not the act of swinging the hammer was impulsive. On balance, I clearly prefer the evidence of Dr. Duska. Where the evidence of Drs. Duska and Hashman conflict, I accept the evidence of Dr. Duska. In addition, I have found additional facts which raise doubt upon the Crown's theory that Diebel was planning to kill Quinn from the moment he left Cereal. It was common for Diebel to drive the long distance from Cereal to Calgary to visit Quinn. The late night drive on September 15, 2004 can not be proven to be a one time or extraordinary occurrence with the specific purpose of killing Quinn. Diebel’s purpose was to see Quinn and spend time with her, as he had done many times before. The primary purpose of the stop at First Quality Industries was to obtain beer. When Diebel and Quinn met in the parking lot, they embraced, and at that point Diebel hoped that the two would go home together for her to sober up. I am also influenced by the fact that from the time that Diebel left Cereal to the time he disposed of the body, he had to stop three times to fuel up the truck, once because he actually ran out of gas. These facts all indicate to me that planning and deliberation were not present prior to the murder. I conclude from this behaviour that his actions were random and unplanned, even if they fall short of being impulsive in the psychiatric sense.

 


[49]            To establish the charge of first degree murder, the Crown is relying in part upon the fact that Diebel picked up the hammer at First Quality Industries. It is argued that this act displays the formulation of the plan to kill Quinn. I am not convinced that the picking up of a hammer is, of itself, sufficient to constitute the act of planning. I attach significance to Dr. Duska’s interpretation that at the time the hammer was taken, it was simply another impulsive act and that it may not have been intended to be used as a weapon. He may have been simply putting a hammer in a truck, and not necessarily selecting a weapon for a planned murder. This interpretation is consistent with other evidence which indicates that Diebel’s behaviour was suggestive of impulsivity.

 

[50]            I turn now to the Crown’s argument that Diebel should be convicted of first degree murder pursuant to s. 231(5) of the Code. This position was raised only at the time of argument and appears to be based on the supposition that Quinn was alive while being removed from the City of Calgary to the vicinity of Cereal where her remains were found. Mr. Hagglund appeared to be drawing on Diebel’s comments in his statement that he heard gurgling noises coming from the body of Ms. Quinn during the course of transporting the body. This in my view is mere speculation on the part of the Crown. There is no medical evidence before this Court to support Mr. Hagglund’s suggestion. Certainly none that would permit me to accept, without more, that this was a situation that fell within the parameters of 231(5).

 

Conclusion

 

[51]            The Crown carries a heavy burden in a case such as this one. It must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was both planned and deliberate. This is a case which presents the unique situation where upon an abundance of evidence, the offender had been previously diagnosed with a disorder, and where one of the features of that disorder in its active state is to cause the accused to act in an impulsive way. There is also evidence to indicate that the offender’s disorder may have been active at the time of the murder, causing him to act impulsively.

 

[52]            There is reliable evidence from the accused's sister in law and indeed from the accused himself, that his behaviour was suggestive of impulsivity. The Crown's own expert was unable to eliminate the possibility that the decision to strike Quinn was made at the last possible moment. I do not find that the distinction Dr. Hashman attempted to draw between ambivalence and impulsivity is sufficient to dispel a reasonable doubt on my part that the murder was not planned.
