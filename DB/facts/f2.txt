The Factual Context



[6]                                                               Gordon Nash was the murder victim and brother of the appellant, Adam Nash. At around 4:30 p.m., on October 31, 2006, Gordon Nash picked up their nephew, Catlin Nash. Gordon and Catlin intended to go hunting. On route, they stopped at an intersection. Adam Nash was also stopped at the same intersection. Adam then gave his brother the “finger”. In response, Gordon got out of his vehicle and the two began fighting. The Pre-Sentence Report suggests that the fight may have been provoked by an earlier incident in which Gordon had reported his brother Adam to the police for driving while impaired.

Tommy and Adam had just spent part of the day in the woods. Tommy testified that Adam had been drinking but was unclear as to the amount consumed. Catlin Nash testified that he saw Adam Nash wield a bat but that Gordon had gotten the best of Adam. Tommy testified that he did see a bat on the side of the road but that Adam was on the losing side of the fight having suffered a “bloody face”.

Adam and Tommy got into their respective vehicles and drove a half kilometre to the latter’s house. Shortly thereafter, Adam decided to pursue his brother Gordon. Along the way, Adam stopped beside a vehicle being driven by Dennis Doiron and asked whether he had seen the white van that Gordon was driving. During this brief conversation, Adam held up a rifle and chambered a bullet. Mr. Doiron told Adam of the direction in which Gordon’s white van was headed. A short while later, while driving on a “woods road”, Adam came upon Gordon’s vehicle. The two vehicles were 20 metres apart and faced one another. Adam fired two shots. The first struck Gordon in the jaw, the second hit him in the head. Death ensued.

Catlin complied and the two drove off together. Adam then told Catlin to telephone Adam’s wife and tell her what had happened. Catlin complied with that demand. Eventually, Adam dropped Catlin off on a country road. Catlin then phoned home and told his parents of the events surrounding the murder.



[10]                                                           Adam Nash drove to his home and telephoned the police and a friend, and told them of the killing. When the police arrived, Adam refused to surrender and fired several shots from the house though not at the police. The standoff lasted through the night and into the next day. At around 3:00 p.m., Adam surrendered himself to the police.



[11]                                                           The jury convicted Adam Nash, of second degree murder. Pursuant to s. 745.2 of the Criminal Code, the trial judge asked the jury whether it wished to make a recommendation with respect to the matter of parole ineligibility. The jury declined the invitation. The trial judge’s sentencing reasons refer to the fact that the 40 year-old appellant had been drinking heavily the night before and the day of the murder. The trial judge recognized that the offence required a “modest amount of planning” but not enough to convince the jury that Adam Nash was guilty of first degree murder (“planned and deliberate”). We are also told that the two brothers’ past relationship had been marked by physical violence. The trial judge acknowledged that the appellant had been co-operative and exceptionally polite when interviewed by the author of the Pre-Sentence Report and that Adam had expressed regret over the devastating effect that the murder had on his own family. At the same time, the trial judge was struck by the callousness of Adam’s behaviour with respect to his nephew who was present when the fatal shots were fired. This observation is followed by the following conclusion: “This is obviously a case where the ten year minimum would not be appropriate.”



[12]                                                           The trial judge went on to state that in considering the “character” of Mr. Nash she could not help but note that he expressed no remorse for the crime nor had he expressed any regret with respect to the effect the killing had on the family of his deceased brother. When dealing with the favorable comments offered in the Pre-Sentence Report, the trial judge again noted Mr. Nash’s failure to express remorse over the killing when given the opportunity to do so at the sentencing hearing. At the same time, the trial judge recognized that Mr. Nash was under no obligation to “say anything”. However, she held that his failure to do so weighed against him when it came to setting the period for parole ineligibility. The trial judge acknowledged that Mr. Nash did not have a “substantial” criminal  record but after looking at the nature of his offence and all of the surrounding circumstances, she was satisfied the period of parole ineligibility should be greater than 10 years. She also acknowledged that according to R. v. Shropshire it was unnecessary for the Crown to establish “extraordinary circumstances” to justify an increase in the period of ineligibility for parole. At the same time, she stated that “… in this case there were some unusual circumstances…” Ultimately, the trial judge concluded that this was a case where parole ineligibility should be extended beyond the 10 year minimum in the name of “deterrence” and decided that the minimum period should be fixed at 20 years. Aside from R. v. Shropshire, the trial judge relied on two decisions in support of the proposition that the 20 year period fell within the “acceptable range”: R. v. Doyle (1991), 108 N.S.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), [1991] N.S.J. No. 447 (QL) and R. v. Walton (1988), 1988 CanLII 7935 (NB CA), 92 N.B.R. (2d) 254 (C.A.), [1988] N.B.J. No. 919 (QL).



[13]                                                           In brief, the trial judge extended Nr. Nash’s parole ineligibility from 10 to 20 years based on three supposed aggravating factors: (1) the failure to express remorse for the killing; (2) the degree of planning that went into the killing; and (3) Mr. Nash’s disregard for the safety of his nephew.  No mitigating factors are singled out.
