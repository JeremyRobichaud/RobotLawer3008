II.               Background Facts
[5]               Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank were each found guilty of three counts of first degree murder in the deaths of Gordon Klaus, Sandra Klaus and Monica Klaus. The facts are set out in my Reasons for Judgment:  R v Klaus, 2018 ABQB 6, [2018] AJ No 17.

[6]               In brief, I found that Mr. Klaus and Mr. Frank formulated a plan for Mr. Frank to kill the three members of the Klaus family for which he would be paid a sum of money by Mr. Klaus. Mr. Frank then intentionally shot to death the three victims following which he set the house on fire to conceal the crime.

[7]               Mr. Klaus did not shoot the members of his family but he planned and deliberated their murders with Mr. Frank. Further, he counselled, procured, solicited, incited and encouraged Mr. Frank to kill the victims. He assisted in the commission of the murders by providing the weapon to Mr. Frank and information about the victims’ whereabouts, including the location of the keys to the house. He transported Mr. Frank to the scene and facilitated Mr. Frank’s departure from the scene. He knew and intended that his acts would aid or abet Mr. Frank. I found Mr. Klaus’ involvement made him a co-principal in relation to the crime of first degree murder of the three victims and, in the alternative, a full-fledged party to the crimes.

III.            Victim Impact Statements
[8]               When determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender, the Court must consider any statement describing harm caused as the result of the commission of the offence and the impact of the offence on a victim:  s 722(1).

[9]               The Court heard seven Victim Impact Statements in this case. They were provided by uncles, aunts and cousins of Jason Klaus. Each described immeasurable personal loss and emotional scarring as a result of these murders. The depth of grief, and the horror each felt at the knowledge of how the victims died, was palpable. In addition, the peaceful and deserved retirement of two family members, Robert and Christine Klaus, has been severely affected. Robert Klaus is the older brother of Gordon Klaus and in his capacity as the Administrator of his brother’s estate he spent a considerable amount of time on the farm property. He contracted a devastating virus as a consequence and spent a considerable amount of time in hospital receiving treatment. Both he and his wife, Christine Klaus, continue to suffer acute health problems that can be traced to the events of December 8, 2013.

[10]           While it is hoped that the judicial process will provide some measure of peace for all those who have suffered, and continue to suffer, as a result of the senseless loss of Gordon, Sandra and Monica Klaus, it is acknowledged that life will never be the same for anyone touched by these events.
