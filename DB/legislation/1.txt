The Pertinent Legislation [6] The provision under which the search warrant was sought and issued is s. 11(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which reads as follows: "11(1) A justice who, on ex parte application, is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds to believe that (a) a controlled substance or precursor in respect of which this Act has been contravened, (b) any thing in which a controlled substance or precursor referred to in paragraph (a) is contained or concealed, (c) offence-related property, or (d) any thing that will afford evidence in respect of an offence under this Act ..." [7] It will be seen that s. 11(1) does not expressly require that the reasonable grounds disclosed by the information on oath be probable. However, it is now settled that "reasonableness" in this context imports a requirement of evidentiary probability. Viewed in this light, the expression "reasonable grounds" meets the requirements of s. 8 of the Charter. See Southam Inc. v.
