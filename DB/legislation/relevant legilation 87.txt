The Law with Respect to Committal at a Preliminary Inquiry

 

[28]            I will begin with the law with respect to committal at a preliminary inquiry.  The following paragraphs (29 - 41) originally appeared in my decision in R. v. Taylor ABPC 354.  As there is a ban on publication on that case, it is not available for review.  Accordingly, I repeat them here, with a few modifications.

 

The Role of a Judge Hearing a Preliminary Inquiry

 

[29]            The conduct of a preliminary inquiry is governed by s. 548 of the Criminal Code[1] which provides, in part:

 

“[w]hen all the evidence has been taken by the justice, he shall,

 

(1)(a) if in his opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction, order the accused to stand trial;”

 

[30]            The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to ensure that there is sufficient evidence to commit the accused to trial.  See Caccamo v. The Queen, 1975 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786; Dubois v. The Queen, 1986 CanLII 60 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 366, at pp. 373-74. Guilt or innocence is not determined at the preliminary inquiry: that question is expressly reserved for trial. R. v. Russell 2001 SCC 53, at paragraph 20.

 

[31]            As a judge presiding at a preliminary inquiry, my role is a modest one.  The classic statement of my role is found in the reasons of in United States of America v. Shephard 1976 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 where Mr. Justice Ritchie, speaking for the majority, said:

 

“The ‘justice’, in accordance with this principle, is, in my opinion, required to commit an accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.” (para. 8)
