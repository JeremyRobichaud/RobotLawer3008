CONCLUSION

[55]      The conviction appeals are dismissed.  Ryan’s sentence appeal is dismissed as abandoned.  Jordan’s sentence appeal is allowed. His sentence is varied to nine months’ incarceration.  We see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that three years’ probation on the terms and conditions he imposed was appropriate.
