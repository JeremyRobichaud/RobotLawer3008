Broad Overview of the Evidence

[3]     There are some inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses who observed the events of March 31. I have endeavoured to set out a broadly coherent narrative of the evidence from the Preliminary Inquiry. A jury will have to sort out the facts at trial.

[4]     In the early morning hours of March 31, Mr. Steele and Mr. Barati had a physical altercation, a fight, which took them into the street outside the house on Seaforth Street where they were living. The police were called.

[5]     The fight began in the kitchen with pushing and shoving. There is evidence that Mr. Barati and Mr. Steele started fighting over Mr. Steele’s refusal to let Mr. Barati contact his cocaine dealer. Mr. Steele was ultimately bested in the fight, which made him angry, and there is evidence his anger toward Mr. Barati may have been stoked by other factors as well.

[6]     When the police arrived on scene they spoke first to Mr. Steele on the street and then his roommates. EHS arrived and between 4:07 a.m. to 4:20 a.m. they checked out an agitated, annoyed and dismissive Mr. Steele.

[7]     Mr. Steele’s Seaforth Street roommates gave the police the all-clear for him to come back into the house. Having satisfied themselves that the situation had settled down, the police decided to leave.

[8]     Mr. Steele’s girlfriend, Christianna Girard, felt he was still being aggressive so she locked the front door before he was able to get inside. Mr. Steele broke the door to get at Mr. Barati in the ground floor hallway which caused Mr. Bunker, another roommate to intervene.

[9]     With Mr. Steele restrained, Mr. Barati went downstairs into a basement bedroom. This was Mr. Steele’s bedroom which Mr. Barati was being allowed to use.  Mr. Barati had just moved back to the Seaforth Street house after an absence. He was able to sleep in Mr. Steele’s bedroom because Mr. Steele had been staying in Ms. Girard’s ground floor bedroom.

[10]   Ms. Girard went down to the basement bedroom with Mr. Barati. She knew Mr. Steele was angry and agitated. She barricaded the basement bedroom door with a television and the table it was on and set about cleaning up some cuts that Mr. Barati had sustained in the fight with Mr. Steele.

[11]   Chad Bunker had some further interaction with Mr. Steele in the hallway of the house. Mr. Steele first wanted to know where Mr. Barati was. Mr. Bunker told him Mr. Barati was downstairs, that is, in the basement. Mr. Steele said nothing, left and then came back. He asked Mr. Bunker to help him. Mr. Bunker told him he was not helping him.

[12]   Mr. Bunker testified that Mr. Steele then went into the kitchen. He could hear the noise of the kitchen drawers being opened. He testified Mr. Steele was in the kitchen “rattling around” for “about five minutes looking for something.” It was his evidence that Mr. Steele came out with something that was “really shiny.” He was, in Mr. Bunker’s words, “really sneaky, he had it under his shirt like he didn’t want me to see…he was tucking something up under his shirt like he did not want anyone to see.” Mr. Steele then went downstairs to the basement. According to Mr. Bunker, Mr. Steele “just walked down the stairs.”

[13]   Mr. Bunker testified it was 10 – 15 minutes later that Ms. Girard called up asking him to come down to the basement. Mr. Bunker went down and observed Mr. Steele arguing with Ms. Girard through the door about getting into his bedroom. Mr. Steele was pushing on the door which Ms. Girard had barricaded.  Mr. Steele ignored Mr. Bunker asking him to “just stop and go upstairs.”

[14]   Mr. Bunker was watching when Mr. Steele kicked the door in and rushed into the room. Ms. Girard punched Mr. Steele and, tackling him at his waist, brought him to his knees. When Mr. Steele fell to his knees, Mr. Bunker saw him take out a long knife, lean forward, and start stabbing Mr. Barati in the back. Mr. Barati was lying on his stomach on a futon.

[15]   Ms. Girard testified that it looked to her as though Mr. Steele was punching Mr. Barati. It was her evidence that she grabbed him and saw that he was holding a knife. She screamed when she saw the knife: What are you doing to him. You are killing him.

[16]   In Ms. Girard’s estimation it was only “like a half a minute” that Mr. Steele was stabbing Mr. Barati. She testified that he snapped out of it and stopped stabbing Mr. Barati when she yelled at him.

[17]   Chad Bunker testified that he grabbed Mr. Steele when he began stabbing Mr. Barati. He bent Mr. Steele’s right hand behind his back and threatened to hurt him if he didn’t stop. Mr. Steele dropped the knife which Mr. Bunker then retrieved.

[18]   Mr. Barati died of his wounds at the scene.         Broad Overview of the Evidence
