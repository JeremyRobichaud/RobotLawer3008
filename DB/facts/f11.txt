STEEL J.A.  (giving the first judgment at the invitation of Twaddle J.A.)



1                     This is an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder after trial by jury.  The accused argues that the trial judge made a number of errors in her charge to the jury, thereby prejudicing their ability to render an impartial verdict.

2                     The deceased, Ms Kimberley Clarke, and the accused, Mr. Roderick Muchikekwanape, were strangers, but on July 24, 1998, both attended the same party.  After the party, the deceased was seen by a number of witnesses first walking in the direction of the Redwood Bridge, accompanied by a male, and then seen walking together with a male at the Redwood Bridge.

3                     At approximately the same time, security personnel from Molson’s Brewery, located near the Redwood Bridge, heard a cut-off scream and, shortly thereafter, saw a figure running north along the riverbank.  They alerted the Winnipeg Police Service, who attended at the scene and discovered a bloody trail leading down the concrete embankment, underneath the bridge to the gravel pathway, up and over the stone wall, and down to the river.  The body of the deceased was eventually found in the river two days later by Harbour Patrol.

4                     The cause of death was due to blunt-force injuries, primarily to the face of the deceased.  The theory of the defence was that the deceased, who was very intoxicated, fell down the steep, rock-embedded concrete embankment in the dark and fell on her face on the stone wall and died of her injuries.  Someone then disposed of her body in the river.  Alternatively, the defence submitted that a drunken man attending the earlier party may have murdered and/or sexually assaulted the deceased.  There was evidence that in the early daylight hours, the drunken man, described as acting strangely and with mud on the knees of his jeans, and who had also been at the Burrows Avenue party, spoke to the householder of the party stating that he had “hurt that girl.”

5                     The theory of the Crown was that the deceased was assaulted by the accused on the embankment and that the assault escalated to the gravel pathway and the stone wall, where the deceased was severely beaten in the face and body and died of the injuries.  Before death, her shorts were removed, and near or after death, her genitals were cut with a knife by the accused.  He then removed her jewellery and disposed of her body in the river.

6                     The accused was seen by a number of civilian witnesses, including his cousin, B. J. Mason, attending at the home of a female acquaintance in the early morning hours.  The accused had blood on him, according to the witnesses, which he subsequently washed off himself and his clothing.  The accused, according to B. J. Mason, told B. J. that he had been in a fight on Dufferin Avenue.  He handed B. J. some bloody jewellery (later identified as the deceased’s jewellery and as her blood) and told him to get rid of it.  B. J. did not do so, but the jewellery and B. J.’s watch were later found by police in the sunroom couch where both B. J. and the accused had slept.  B. J.’s watch also had the deceased’s blood on it.  B. J. testified that the accused wore the watch that night.

7                     Both the Crown and the defence relied heavily on expert evidence with respect to two issues:

(1)     whether death was the result of an accidental fall or the result of an intentional assault; and

(2)     whether evidence was adduced with respect to the issue of the sexual assault of the deceased prior or at the point of her death, during the physical assault that caused her death, or whether these acts occurred after her death.

8                     With respect to whether the death was accidental or intentional, both the Crown and the defence called blood-spatter experts to interpret bloodstains at the scene.  Both experts agreed that the bloodstains leading from the concrete embankment were caused by blood which had dripped from the body as opposed to blood spattering as a result of a beating.  Both pathologists and both blood-spatter experts agreed that the deceased likely died at the stone wall and she was then dragged up and over the stone wall, bleeding on the way, to the river, where the body was disposed of in the water.

9                     The point at which the blood-spatter experts disagreed was the interpretation of the bloodstains in the gravel pathway and on the stone wall.  For example, the Crown expert, Constable Rautavuori, testified that he saw blood “pools” in the gravel pathway and on the stone wall, which was, in his opinion, likely caused by beating the deceased’s face with a rock.  He testified that, in his opinion, the deceased was the victim of an escalating assault which started on the embankment, causing the initial blood flow, then escalating to a severe beating, leaving blood pools in the gravel pathway and on the stone wall.

10                 The defence expert, Constable Slemko, disagreed that the stains on the gravel pathway were blood pools suggesting severe trauma, but rather, in his opinion, were “contact transfer stains” produced when the body had contact with the pathway surface.  The stone wall surface was uneven and made it difficult to interpret the type of bloodstains found there as the surface caused distortion of the bloodstain pattern.  Therefore, the defence expert testified that the blood on the wall was as consistent with a beating as with a fall.

11                 The Crown pathologist testified that the deceased was more likely beaten to death than died as a result of an accidental fall.  However, both the Crown and defence pathologist agreed that, save for the genital injury, the injuries suffered by the deceased could have been caused by between one and three accidental falls.

12                 With respect to the question of sexual assault, the deceased, when found, was missing the clothing on her lower body and was found to have a one and one-half inch laceration to her genital tract.  The Crown pathologist testified that the fact that the deceased was found without her denim shorts, together with significant abrasions on her hip which were received before death and the genital tract injury which was intentionally made, were all indications that the deceased was sexually assaulted either before or at the time of her death.

13                 But the defence pathologist stated that the hip abrasions could have occurred when the shorts were on, that the hip bruising could have occurred up to two days prior to death, and that the genital tract injury was caused after death and could have been caused accidentally by glass or debris in the 48 hours that the body was in the river.
