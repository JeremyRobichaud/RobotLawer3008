[1]               On the evening of May 7, 2013, Emergency Medical Services (“EMS”) were called to the home of the Defendants (the “Raditas”) where they found a boy dead in a bedroom at their home located in northwest Calgary. Although the deceased, Alexandru Radita (“Alex”) was 15 years of age, the autopsy performed the next day revealed that he weighed a mere 17 kg (approximately 37 lbs) and measured only 131 cm (approximately 4’3”) at death. The cause of death was determined to be bacterial sepsis resulting, not surprisingly, from neglect and starvation. His death was unnecessary and completely avoidable. It also occurred over time and would have been very painful.

[2]               The Defendants are Alex’s biological parents and stand jointly charged with his murder in the first degree. Both Defendants deny liability for first degree murder including the lesser offence of second degree murder, but concede that the evidence does support a conviction for manslaughter as joint principals.

[3]               At the time of Alex’s death he resided with his parents and seven other siblings, ranging in age from 12 to 24 years, with five siblings being over the age of 18 at the time of his death. Their home was a two-storey house with four bedrooms upstairs and two more large shared bedrooms in the basement area. Alex was found by EMS in the upstairs bedroom of his parents’.

[4]               Mr. Radita was employed working outside the home while Mrs. Radita was a full-time caregiver to Alex and two younger siblings. Alex had not been enrolled in an education program of any kind for a number of years at the time of his death. The other siblings, aside from CR, age 14, who it was later determined suffered from learning disabilities, were either attending school or employed. To all outward appearances, the Raditas seemed to be running a normal busy household filled with two adults and their eight children.

[5]               However, the care that the Raditas failed to provide to Alex over what was likely a number of years is the cornerstone of this trial.

II.               Facts
[6]               Alex was born on January 30, 1998. He first came to the attention of medical personnel in mid-December 2000, when both of his parents brought him to the Surrey Memorial Hospital (“SMH”) in Surrey, British Columbia, in the early evening of December 13, 2000.  Alex was then nearly three years of age. At that time Dr. White, an on-call pediatrician, confirmed, after laboratory tests were completed, that Alex suffered from Type 1 diabetes. His condition upon admission was:

1.      an altered state of consciousness;

2.      abdominal pain;

3.      quite ill, vomiting;

4.      thirsty for water;

5.      dark circles under his eyes;

6.      fever; and

7.      his breath smelled clearly of ketones.

[7]               Dr. White was able to diagnose Alex even before the laboratory tests  returned as he was presenting with classic symptoms of diabetes. Alex was stabilized and transferred to the British Columbia Children’s Hospital (BCCH) Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to his age, the severity of his condition and the training his parents would subsequently require to care for him.

[8]               Prior to his transfer, Dr. White spoke with Mrs. Radita who made it clear that in her view the diagnosis was incorrect and she would prove that the doctors were wrong.

[9]               Dr. Pacaud, an expert in pediatric endocrinology, provided expert evidence at this trial on diabetes, its treatment and the consequences of mismanaging its treatment. Over 75 percent of Dr. Pacaud’s practice is given over to the treatment of diabetic children.

[10]           It is appropriate at this time to summarize the evidence that the Court heard with respect to diabetes and its treatment in children.

A.   Diabetes
[11]           Dr. Pacaud explained that diabetes is caused by either a non-existent or insufficient amount of insulin produced by a person’s pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that allows the body to utilize the sugar or glucose that is consumed by a person daily. It is the key that opens the door between sugar and the body’s ability to turn that sugar into energy.

[12]           Insulin regulates a person’s blood sugar to remain within a range of four to seven millimoles per litre for adults and six to ten millimoles for young children. A blood sugar reading above seven persistently leads to hyperglycemia, a condition that, if not treated leads to ketoacidosis. This condition means that sugar (glucose) has not been converted to energy as there is insufficient or no insulin. This glucose then becomes trapped in the blood stream and becomes too much for the kidneys to process. The kidneys then allow the glucose to be released, increasing the volume of urine with the result that a person has the desire and need to urinate more frequently. The body meanwhile, with no glucose energy, will start to burn its fat stores resulting in an abundance of ketones which will then build up in the blood making the blood acidic. This leads to nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and eventually coma, shock and death. This condition in a diabetic is referred to as diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA.

[13]           Hypoglycemia, on the other hand, is when the blood sugar level falls below four or six or is too low. This creates symptoms of anxiety, shakiness, hunger and fatigue. It is caused by too much insulin in the system thereby causing the glucose to be processed too quickly.

[14]           The body ordinarily regulates its secretion of insulin very finely, adjusting the amount every few minutes with the amount of its release dependent upon the level of physical exertion and sugar intake.

[15]           A Type 1 diabetic is someone whose body, for reasons that are not yet known, stops producing insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the kind associated with lifestyle, obesity, physical inactivity and poor eating habits.

[16]           A Type 1 diabetic can never recover from this condition. The condition can however be successfully treated with insulin and if managed appropriately most sufferers lead long and active lives.

[17]           Replacement insulin used in the treatment of diabetes involves a therapy or protocol that combines both a long acting insulin and a short acting insulin to try to duplicate the body’s usual secretion of insulin. The insulin is administered usually with a syringe, a pen, a needle or a pump. An average toddler gets between 5 and 10 insulin units a day.

[18]           As children grow older the volume of insulin required increases with weight gain. Teenagers are generally insulin resistant and therefore require higher insulin dosages than adults of the same size. A teenage boy may need up to 1 to 1.2 units per kilogram or anywhere between 40 to 80 units of insulin a day.

[19]           Children in Canada rarely die from diabetes. However, proper treatment requires daily vigilance in order to ensure chronic problems do not develop. Chronic poor diabetes control can result in loss of eyesight, loss of circulation and sensation in the extremities, damage to kidneys, high blood pressure, circulatory disease, damage to the liver and poor growth. If treated appropriately, life expectancy for children with diabetes is 65 to 70 years of age.

B.     Diabetes Treatment of Children
[20]           Once a child has been diagnosed with diabetes the family is referred to a diabetes clinic where the parents and child, if old enough, are taught the particulars of the disease, what a normal blood sugar range is, and how to monitor their own blood sugar.

[21]           Each sufferer must administer a finger poke several times a day to obtain a spot of blood. The blood is then placed on a test strip and the strip is placed into a glucose meter which then reads and displays the blood glucose level. Typically a child would do at least four finger pokes a day and have at least three insulin injections a day.

[22]           The clinic also teaches the parents and the child how to manage food intake and nutritional needs. The sufferer is not required to follow a special diet but rather is taught how to understand glucose levels in differing foods and how to plan their own diet.

[23]           Families learn how to calculate the grams of carbohydrates in food in order to adjust the insulin dosage required. A daily log book is kept by the family to keep track of the blood sugar readings. The log book is then reviewed with the child’s doctor, at a minimum every three months, at a clinic visit.

[24]           At a typical clinic visit, a blood test for hemoglobin A1C is given. This measures the glucose attached to the patients’ red blood cells. This is a very important test because it gives a good idea of what the average blood sugar of the patient has been over the preceding three month period. If the blood glucose is high or low it generally means the family has been doing a poor job of insulin administration and more training may be required. If it is within the acceptable range it means the family has been doing a good job of administering the child’s insulin.

[25]           Additionally the log books are reviewed and a nutritional counsellor meets with the family to discuss how the insulin adjustments and diet plan are working. The patient is also weighed and measured to ensure growth is within acceptable milestones, and is also compared to the individual’s prior statistics.

[26]           Historically, before the discovery of insulin in 1922, the life expectancy of a child post-diagnosis of diabetes was approximately one year. It was determined that a starvation diet, which would reduce the volume  of unprocessable  glucose in the sufferer’s blood, could prolong the life of Type 1 sufferers by preventing fatal DKA. The child would eventually die however of starvation which often featured infection.

[27]           Without glucose, the body uses its fat stores for energy but as the fat stores are depleted the body will then start to use its muscle as its source of energy. Essentially, although the starvation diet warded off a quick death by DKA, this was at the expense of whole body reserves.

[28]           In Canada, families generally receive diabetic supplies, including insulin, a device to administer insulin, a blood sugar meter, meter test strips, a lancet to perform finger pokes, ketone strips to measure ketones, and clinic contact information including an emergency hotline phone number, all free of charge.

C.   British Columbia Children’s Hospital / 2000
[29]           Alex was transferred to the BCCH on December 14, 2000, where he came under the care of Dr. Daniel Metzger, a pediatrician specializing in children with diabetes. He made a diagnosis that Alex was in a state of DKA upon transfer from SMH. After testing he too confirmed that Alex was a Type 1 diabetic.

[30]           Dr. Metzger was more or less involved with Alex’s diabetic care from this point until the Raditas left the Vancouver area, sometime in 2008 or 2009. Dr. Metzger was a witness in the trial.

[31]           In December 2000, Dr. Metzger formed the view that the Raditas were in gross denial of Alex’s disease. He called in a social worker employed by BCCH as well as the Ministry for Children and Family Services (the “Ministry”) to interview and speak to the Raditas because their hostility to the medical personnel had become obvious.

[32]           It was impressed upon Mr. and Mrs. Radita by the Ministry and the social worker that diabetes was a treatable but dangerous disease and that if they did not start cooperating, and learning how to manage Alex’s diabetes, Alex would not be released into their care.

[33]           Both parents were present at most times with Mrs. Radita appearing to do most of the talking. Eventually Mr. and Mrs. Radita demonstrated the requisite degree of knowledge and ability to treat Alex’s diabetes and Alex was discharged into their care on December 22, 2000.

[34]           BCCH arranged for Alex and his parents to receive extra nursing support once he was at home. A nurse came twice a day for a period of several weeks.

[35]           BCCH followed Alex’s care after his discharge. After a clinic visit in February 2001, Dr. Metzger became very suspicious that someone at the Radita home was falsifying blood glucose readings as they were too good and were in contrast to the fact that Alex had been losing weight. As a result he instructed a nurse to check the blood sugar readings kept by  the Raditas and found that high blood sugar readings were followed by low blood sugar readings within minutes. This was not medically possible. Dr. Metzger inferred as a result that the daily log book kept by the Raditas was not being recorded truthfully and some of the good readings were not from a test of Alex’s blood. This could result in Alex being given too little insulin thereby risking DKA again.

[36]           The Raditas denied this behaviour, claimed that BCCH was persecuting them and denied that they had been given sufficient training by BCCH.

[37]           Alex was readmitted to SMH on March 16, 2001, as a result of poor compliance and a need for the Raditas to receive further education in diabetes management. The Raditas attended at SMH for a further period of training at this time.

[38]           Because he believed the falsifying of the log book recordings was a serious issue, Dr. Metzger recommended to the Ministry at this time that Alex be apprehended. Instead, on April 4, 2001 Alex was discharged back into the care of his parents but under the continuing care of Dr. White rather than Dr. Metzger. This was as a result of SMH being closer to the Radita home but also because the Raditas objected to Dr. Metzger.

D.   Teaching Diabetes for Families
[39]           Dr. Pacaud explained that Canadian diabetic clinics teach families how to manage the diabetes regime or protocol for their child. They are taught about the particulars of the disease, how to monitor blood sugar levels, how to prepare and inject insulin and how to manage food intake.

[40]           Most importantly, the families are told what symptoms or conditions to worry about and when and how to get medical help. There is access to an open hotline in all major centres.

[41]           Initially, families will call the clinic daily in order to be given the insulin dosages for their child for that day based on their blood sugar readings. Some families and patients become more proficient than others over time. Some families require clinic support for years.

[42]           Because diabetes can have deathly consequences all diabetic medical supplies are provided free of charge, including insulin. A diabetic sufferer does not require a prescription to purchase insulin from a pharmacy.

E.     Dr. White / 2001
[43]           The Raditas brought Alex to Dr. White’s diabetic clinic from April 2001 to September 2001, a total of 11 visits. Initially, the Defendants brought Alex for weekly visits, then beginning in May 1, 2001, every two weeks, finally tapering to every month in June, July, August and September. Dr. White’s records disclosed that both parents came to almost all of the clinic visits.

[44]           After Alex’s last appointment on September 18, 2001, Dr. White moved the address of his clinic by one kilometre. The Defendants failed to bring Alex to see him again after that.

[45]           Initially, the log book revealed very high blood sugar readings and bruising at the injection sites. Periodically Dr. White emphasized good food choices to the Raditas.

[46]            On each visit Alex also had tests administered and nutritional discussions were held with his parents. The Raditas refused to continue the nutritional meetings after their July 17, 2001, visit, insisting that the meetings with Dr. White were sufficient.

[47]           Over the 11 appointments Alex’s weight went from 14.7 kilograms on March 16, 2001, to 20 kilograms on the last visit September 18, 2001. On the last visit Dr. White noted and discussed with the Raditas that they were not to adjust Alex’s insulin dosage without medical approval.

F.     Surrey Medical Hospital / British Columbia Children’s Hospital / 2003
[48]           On October 16, 2003, Alex was brought to the emergency room at the SMH at approximately 7:00 a.m. by ambulance in a state of malnutrition, suffering from hypoglycemia and an altered state of consciousness, a result of Alex’s extreme condition. He was almost six years old at this time. Dr. White recommended stabilizing Alex and transferring him to BCCH.

[49]           Mrs. Radita told Dr. White they had not taken Alex for medical care for over two years. She also advised that she had drastically altered his insulin regime because he had a rash.  Mrs. Radita reported to SMH personnel, including Dr. White, that Alex, despite obvious muscle loss and distended stomach, had only been unwell for one week prior to his hospital admission. Dr. White was of the view that Alex was suffering from a severe state of chronic malnutrition and was in a tenuous cardiac state. SMH contacted the RCMP and the Ministry to report Alex’s condition.

[50]           Alex was transferred to BCCH the afternoon of October 16, 2003. Dr. Seear, an intensive care physician was present at BCCH when Alex was admitted into its ICU in both December 2000 and October 2003.

[51]           Dr. Seear recalled Mrs. Radita telling him in 2000, that Alex did not have diabetes. In 2003, when he was told that the Raditas had advised hospital personnel that Alex had been sick for a week only, he categorically rejected this and indicated that at a minimum Alex had been sick for two months.

[52]           Dr. Seear was qualified before this Court as an expert in malnutrition. Dr. Seear gave evidence of the phases of starvation. He explained that if a person does not eat, the body will first turn to glycogen stores which will be turned into sugar for use. These stores only last approximately 48 hours. When the body is starved of glucose it will next utilize its fat stores. These fat stores can take anywhere from one to three months to burn completely depending on how much fat the body has.  The body will then burn protein starting with the stomach lining (which causes diarrhea), then its muscles. At this stage the sufferer will be close to death and will be “skin and bone.”

[53]           Dr. Seear testified that skin ulcerations are a common feature of children in advances stages of malnutrition.

[54]           Dr. Seear’s view was that in October 2003, Alex was within one day of death. He had never seen a patient as starved as Alex.

[55]           From his view of Alex’s birthday photos taken close to January 30, 2013, Dr. Seear was of the view that Alex would have taken at least a couple of months with no food to get to the state depicted in the photos. With the administration of a little insulin and a little food it was impossible to say how long it might have taken.

[56]           After Alex was admitted to the BCCH ICU he was attended by Dr. Korn, an expert in pediatric emergency medicine and so qualified as an expert in this area at this trial. His description of Alex’s state upon admission bears repeating here:

Alex had profound malnutrition. He had no subcutaneous tissue, and he had what we call “peripheral edema”. His legs were very swollen. He had a big swollen abdomen which had fluid in it called “ascites”. He had pleural effusion, which is fluid between the lung wall and lung itself. Fluid shouldn’t be there. And he had fluid around his heart. We also knew that they had a – he had a big liver. He had a mass behind his stomach, which I believe was finally diagnosed as a pancreatic pseudo cyst. The blood work was entirely consistent with the concerns, in that his protein in the blood was very low, and that’s what was causing this edema with malnutrition. He also was profoundly anemic, so – and his hemoglobin was 44, which is really really low for a child of this age, and he was very pale. He had mildly enlarged kidneys because when you’re profoundly dehydrated you end up with damage to the kidneys.

[57]           BCCH records reveal that additionally Alex had pneumonia and bacteremia. He had straphlycoccus aureus growing in his blood. He also had candida growing on his tongue and in his urine. He also had significant dental issues. His teeth were rotted away.

[58]           Dr. Korn first met the Raditas on October 17, 2003. The Raditas advised Dr. Korn that Alex had only been sick for a couple of weeks when he got a viral infection and began vomiting. Dr. Korn could not reconcile this information to the physical state Alex was then in. He asked Mrs. Radita directly whether she understood that Alex had diabetes. She did not respond.

[59]           Dr. Korn interviewed the Raditas and reviewed Alex’s medical history so that he could advise the Ministry whether Alex could be returned to his family upon a successful hospital discharge. He also remarked that he had never seen a patient as malnourished as Alex in his career.

[60]           Mr. Radita said they were positive Alex had a different medical issue, that being malabsorption, that his body just could not absorb his food properly.

[61]           Dr. Korn ran tests to determine if Alex suffered from malabsorption. No evidence was ever found to support this hypothesis. To the contrary, Alex thrived in the hospital under a daily insulin protocol. Within one month he had gained weight, the cyst in his stomach had disappeared and a non-viral hepatitis secondary to starvation was gone. He was now a healthy looking boy with “chipmunk’s cheeks”. The change was that he was now receiving nutrition and regular injections of insulin. He weighed approximately 20 kilograms upon discharge from BCCH on December 31, 2003.

[62]           As Dr. Korn could find no other reason for Alex’s condition in October 2003 he concluded that Alex had been denied proper nutrition and insulin by the Raditas and this had caused his profoundly deteriorated physical state. Dr. Korn was concerned that the Raditas could not demonstrate that they accepted that Alex had diabetes and that they could manage it.

[63]           As a result, Dr. Korn recommended to the Ministry that Alex be removed from the care of his parents.

[64]           The Ministry apprehended Alex while he was at the BCCH and placed him in foster care. His foster mother was also a Type 1 diabetic.

G.   Judge Cohen’s Order / 2004
[65]           Alex remained in foster care for the whole of 2004. Dr. Metzger again became Alex’s pediatrician and Alex attended at Dr. Metzger’s clinic consistently for the year with his foster mother and occasionally, his social worker, Patricia Macdonald.

[66]           Patricia Macdonald was employed by the Ministry and took over Alex’s file in 2004. She gave evidence in this trial.

[67]           Ms. Macdonald related that Alex was a sweet natured child who was very outgoing, loved to joke and loved going to school.

[68]           Alex was enrolled in kindergarten and had completed grade three by June 2008. His report cards reflect an average learner. His grade three teacher remarked that he “is a good natured and dependable child”.

[69]           Dr. Metzger reported during a April 2004 clinic visit that Alex had learned to do his own finger pokes. Alex’s weight was recorded as 24 kilograms, representing a weight gain since October 29, 2003 of over 11 kilograms.

[70]           Ms. Macdonald initiated a court process for a Continuing Custody Order that would terminate the Radita’s parental rights and allow Alex to be adopted.

[71]           The hearing took place in early December 2004 before  Judge Cohen in  provincial court. Judge Cohen read his oral reasons out loud in court on December 21, 2004. Ms. Macdonald  confirmed that Mr. and Mrs. Radita were each present during the entirety of Judge Cohen’s oral reasons as was she.

[72]           Judge Cohen made many fact findings in his decision. These facts are not evidence in this trial and cannot be used as such. However, it is important to note that both the Accused were in court while these fact findings were read aloud. The relevant fact findings were:

1.      When Alex was admitted to SMH in December 2000 he was in a state of DKA and the diagnosis of diabetes was obvious and apparent;

2.      Alex had not seen a doctor between September 2001 and October 2003 and the Raditas had not purchased insulin since May 2003;

3.      Mrs. Radita had changed Alex’s insulin regime which caused his admission to SMH and BCCH in October 2003 in a state of severe malnutrition with an extended abdomen and emaciated limbs, loss of hair, and a pale/gray complexion. Judge Cohen did not accept that this condition had come on suddenly;

4.      The changes to Alex’s insulin regime meant he had had insufficient insulin for months. As a result the food he ate and the quantity of insulin he did receive did not result in his body absorbing nutrition and as a result he developed Kwashiorkor, an illness associated to parts of the world where there is not enough food;

5.      Alex could not have developed Kwashiorkor without being given at least some insulin by his parents as he would not have developed a wasting disease, instead he would have died much more quickly;

6.      The Raditas did not deny that Alex had diabetes, nor did they withdraw treatment, instead they poorly managed the complex treatment regime;

7.      The Raditas acted inappropriately in changing Alex’s insulin regime without seeking medical advice and therefore Alex needed protection in October 2003;

8.      The Raditas had now accepted the diagnosis of diabetes and they would now treat it properly given sufficient education and monitoring;

9.      Alex was now under the watchful eye of a teacher and the family now had a family doctor (at that time expected to be Dr. White), who would contact authorities if they stopped seeing him;

10.   The family had not previously experienced a major hospitalization with Alex as they now had. They would therefore know how to look for gradual changes as well as rapid ones; and

11.   The Raditas made a major mistake in the management of Alex’s insulin regime. Their mistake was in the proper dosing and types of insulin.

[73]           As a result of Judge’s Cohen’s order Alex was returned to his parent’s care in January 2005.

H.   Dr. Metzger / 2005 - 2008
[74]           Dr. Metzger and his clinic team continued to be Alex’s primary medical caregivers. The Raditas attended every clinic visit together after they regained custody of Alex.

[75]           It was clear to Dr. Metzger that the Raditas understood that he would report to the Ministry, as he had before, if he had any concerns about their management of Alex’s diabetes.

[76]           The first visit with Alex and his parents at Dr. Metzger’s clinic was April 4, 2005. Alex was seven years old. At each visit Alex’s height and weight were measured and his A1C test was administered. On April 4, 2005 Alex weighed 33.7 kilograms (roughly 74 lbs) and measured 118.4 cm (3’11”). His A1C was 8.0 percent which is the target for children of his age for glucose levels in the blood over the three month period prior to the test being given.

[77]           In June 2005, both Mr. and Mrs. Radita wrote letters that were faxed to Dr. Metzger’s clinic. Mr. Radita’s letter was typed and faxed June 10, 2005. Mrs. Radita’s two letters are handwritten with one faxed June 10, 2005 and the other June 15, 2005. The gist of these letters was that the Raditas were having difficulty accessing the diabetic supplies they required since their health care insurance for Alex had been stopped and transferred while Alex was in foster care. They were now running out of the supplies they had previously been given at the first clinic visit. Mrs. Radita’s June 10, 2005, letter is of particular interest as she states “the strips one Thuch (sic) Ultra are more of an emergency and for the way you ask me to test him I need 300 strips every 60 days which would cost $300.00 extremely expensive”.

[78]           At the August 20, 2005, visit Alex weighed 34.2 kilograms (roughly 75 pounds) and measured 121.0 cm (roughly 3.9”). His A1C test was 7.3 percent. He and his family were congratulated by the team on Alex’s excellent diabetes control to this point and his next appointment was scheduled for December 12, 2005. It was noted that Alex was doing four to five finger pokes a day himself but his mother was doing most of the diabetes care.

[79]           At the December 2005, visit Alex had continued to gain weight and grow, his A1C test was 7.9 percent, again, meaning that over the prior three months his blood glucose levels were within the acceptable target range for children of his age.

[80]           At the May 2006 visit, Alex, now eight years old, had again gained weight and grown, his A1C test was 8.6 percent. It was noted that Mrs. Radita did not want to increase Alex’s insulin dosage as instructed as she feared it would give him cold sores. It was explained to her that this was incorrect.

[81]           At the January 22, 2007 visit Alex was now nearly nine years of age and in grade two. He weighed 41.3 kilograms (or roughly 91 lbs.) and measured 126.7 cm (just over 4’1”). He was 97 percentile for weight and 10.2 percentile for height.  His A1C test was 7.4 percent.

[82]           At the August 27, 2007 clinic visit Alex’s family were once again commended for keeping his diabetes in good control. His A1C was 7.9 percent.

[83]           At the January 16, 2008 clinic visit, Alex’s last, he was nearly ten years old, and in grade three. His weight was 41.1 kilograms (roughly the same as one year prior), his height was 131.8 cm. (roughly 4’ 4”) and his A1C was 8.8 percent.

[84]           At this last visit, Dr. Metzger was concerned that Mrs. Radita was resisting increasing Alex’s insulin dosage due to her recurrent fear that it caused cold sores. Again Dr. Metzger impressed upon her they were caused by a virus and not insulin. Dr. Metzger unequivocally instructed Mrs. Radita to increase Alex’s insulin dosage. He never saw Alex again.

[85]           At this visit the Raditas were given July 14, 2008, as their next appointment. When they failed to attend, the appointment was rolled to the next six month period which was January 5, 2009.

[86]           Jana Wong, a social worker employed with the Endocrine Unit of the BCCH from 2000 to 2009, gave evidence at this trial. She first met with the Raditas in December 2000, and recalls them well. Although Mrs. Radita was resistant to the diagnosis in December 2000, she and Mr. Radita attended for training and Ms. Wong was satisfied that they had learned how to competently treat the disease such that Alex could be released to their care December 31, 2000. Ms. Wong arranged for home care nursing for the first few weeks of January 2001.

[87]           Ms. Wong confirmed that Dr. Metzger asked her to follow up with the Raditas in January 2009, when they failed to attend a clinic appointment for the second time. She tried all the phone numbers in their system without success in making contact. She then searched the Pharmacare system in British Columbia into which all pharmaceutical purchases in the province are entered. It showed the last insulin prescription for Alex was filled in December 2008, for a three month supply. Ms. Wong wrote the Ministry on January 8, 2009, with her findings, and tried to follow up with the Ministry in late February 2009, to no avail.

[88]           Ravinder Dhami, a social worker with the Ministry in 2009, also gave evidence in this trial. She confirmed she spoke with Ms. Wong in January 2009 as to Alex’s missed appointments and diabetic condition. She tried to find contact information for the Raditas in Vancouver and surrounding area. Alex’s last school, Parkside, recorded him withdrawing from their school in September 2008, but she was given a Calgary address for his brother. Her team leader directed her to close the file due to insufficient information which she did.

I.      Alberta / 2009 - 2013
[89]            Alex was registered to receive medical services in Alberta sometime in 2009, however no medical examinations or services were ever billed. Prescription records show that beginning in the spring of 2009, insulin, syringes and test strips were purchased at a value of $1,603.31. In 2010, diabetes related drugs and equipment were purchased at a value of $ 3,033.89.  In 2011, similar supplies were purchased at a value of $880.59 and again in 2012 for $109.38. No diabetes related medication or products were purchased under Alex’s name in 2013. All purchases were covered by Alberta Health Care.

[90]           Alex was registered in a home schooling program in September 2009 with the School of Hope in Alberta. He did not submit any work and was withdrawn by the School of Hope from their program as a result in June 2010. It was the school’s practice to have a teacher attend each fall at the home of its enrolled student. A home visit was conducted at the Radita home on October 1, 2009.

[91]           Alex was never registered in any other school in Alberta after June 2010.

[92]           At the time of Alex’s death, May 7, 2013, the police found two glucose meters in his home. One was a One Touch Ultra Smart monitor. The other was a One Touch Ultra II monitor.

[93]           Anita Dobson was qualified as an expert in diabetes education and glucose monitoring in this trial. She examined and analyzed the blood glucose readings in each monitor and determined that:

1.      the readings on each monitor were for consecutive dates with one recording 2,573 readings between April 1, 2005 and July 20, 2009 and the other one recording 14 readings: 11 in 2010; 2 in 2011; and one for 2012;

2.      testing frequency increases at the end of 2007, and the readings show significantly high blood glucose per millimoles, above the recommended 10 percent for adults;

3.      there are no tests on the One Touch Ultra Smart monitor after July 20, 2009 and the first reading on the other monitor begins March 18, 2010, a period elapsed of nearly eight months;

4.      there is only one normal blood sugar reading on the One Touch Ultra Smart II monitor and it is recorded on June 26, 2011. The rest are all high except for one low reading on July 15, 2010.

[94]           In Ms. Dobson’s opinion, if these monitors were the only monitors in use over this period the testing would be grossly inadequate.

[95]           Four witnesses in this trial were called to give evidence about the Radita family and Alex during this time period. Three were called by the Crown, while the fourth, A.R., was called by the Defendants. She is a family member and a minor who cannot be named due to a publication ban granted by this Court.

[96]           Nicolae Brancu gave evidence for the Crown. He was the leader or pastor of the Romanian Apostolic Church (the “Church”) between 2009 and May 2013. He met Mr. Radita at the Church initially and then the balance of the Radita family thereafter. He had no recollection of ever meeting Alex however he indicated Mr. Radita came to church often, as in several times a week. Sometimes other members of the family were with him, sometimes not. Mrs. Radita did attend but not often.

[97]           Two to three months before Alex died Mr. Radita mentioned to him that Alex had cancer, then two to three weeks before Alex died Mr. Radita mentioned that Alex was good now. A few days prior to Alex dying Mr. Radita told Mr. Brancu that Alex had some problems again. On the day that Alex died, May 7, 2013, Mr. Brancu learned from some of the Radita siblings that Alex was not walking or talking.

[98]           On the evening of May 7, 2013, Mr. Brancu and seven or eight people from the Church went to the Radita home around 9:00 p.m. He went straight to the bedroom where Alex lay. He knew immediately Alex was dead. Mrs. Radita was lying beside Alex on the bed and touching him. He told Mr. Radita immediately to call an ambulance which Mr. Radita did but only after speaking to his family first.

[99]           Marius Ciltan also gave evidence for the Crown. He knew the family through the Church as well. He thought he met Mr. Radita soon after he moved to Calgary and met the rest of the Radita family approximately one year later. He recalled seeing Alex once or twice before he died when he was a guest of the family. He could not recall when but said it was at a different house months before. He thought Alex looked good at that time.

[100]      Mr. Ciltan first learned Alex was sick the morning of May 7, 2013. He received a phone call from a Church member who told him Alex had died and been resurrected. He called Mr. Radita at his place of employment. Mr. Radita said he did not know if Alex was dead but asked him to go to his house to pray with his family.

[101]      Mr. Ciltan arrived at the Radita home some time that day. Mrs. Radita and her children were there. Mrs. Radita told him Alex is dead and now is alive and they were praying to make his body strong. After approximately one hour of praying he asked to see Alex. Upon seeing Alex he was shocked. Alex was very skinny with white skin. He asked Mrs. Radita “it’s alive?” She said yes he was breathing one to two hours ago and had a bowel movement.

[102]      Mr. Ciltan went to the Church around 5:00 p.m. Two of the Radita siblings went with him. One of them told the congregation that her brother had died the night before before but God had resurrected him. Then many of them, including Mr. Ciltan and the siblings returned to the Radita home. One of the Elders of the Church asked “it’s alive?” upon seeing Alex. Mrs. Radita repeated to him that Alex had died but had blinked his eyes and was breathing in the morning. This Elder told Mr. Radita to call an ambulance and he did. The ambulance arrived within minutes.

[103]      Sometime after that night Mr. Radita told Mr. Ciltan that when they were in Vancouver the doctors had made Alex sick with diabetes by giving him insulin. He also told Mr. Ciltan that he had recorded DVDs of the doctors abusing Alex in Vancouver so they decided not to let doctors treat Alex any longer as they could treat him at home.

[104]      Both Mr. Ciltan and Mr. Brancu denied that the Church taught not to trust doctors and that they and their family saw doctors when needed.

[105]      Eunice Pop was a young woman who at one time in 2013 was friendly with one of Alex’s siblings. She saw the family at Church after she moved to Calgary in March 2013 although she never saw Alex in Church.

[106]      Sometime in March 2013, or early April 2013, she could not be sure, she went by the Radita home to pick up the Radita sibling to go to a mall. She saw Alex coming down some stairs and heading towards the kitchen. They chatted. Alex commented on the weather and said he was going to go eat. To her he looked sick, young and “really really small”. His skin looked yellowish, his face was pale and he had a hole in his neck. He descended the stairs slowly holding the railing and walked at a snail’s pace.

[107]      She was told by one of Alex’s siblings after he died that he had had cancer. She had known the Radita family briefly when she and her family and the Raditas all lived in British Columbia. From that time she knew Alex was a diabetic and that he was sick. She recalled members of the Church congregation then being asked to pray for him but could not recall exactly when or how often.

[108]      A.R. identified many photos of Alex and other family members before he died but couldn’t be sure of the dates. She also identified videos of Alex and other family members taken in the house but also on two separate occasions outside the house. One video was of Alex and other members of the family at a fast food restaurant while the other video was in a car travelling somewhere. In all the photos and the videos no one else but family members are present in the sense that they are with Alex. A.R. recalled that Alex was a smart, creative boy who enjoyed making art. She recalled Alex refusing to eat often but could not recall why. She  recalled Alex being sick before he died but could not be sure for how long and what he was sick with. A.R. understood both parents cared for Alex and looked after him but they did not believe in doctors. She understood that no one in the family went to a doctor due to their religion.

J.      May 7, 2013
[109]      EMS personnel arrived at the Radita home just after 10:00 p.m. on May 7, 2013. Deborah Baumback, a paramedic employed by Alberta Health Services, was the senior member of the three person EMS team and gave evidence in this trial. When she and her team arrived and entered the home, there was a large number of men and women in the living room chanting, but not in a language she could understand. Her team made their way upstairs to the bedroom where Alex was. She described him as emaciated to the point where he appeared “mummified”. His face had no visible flesh left as she could see every bone in his face. He had black, necrotic sores on his face and his left jaw had open sores so deep she could see his jaw bone. There was nothing left of his stomach as he was just so extraordinarily skinny. She estimated his waistline to be approximately three inches. He was dressed in a diaper and t-shirt. His eyes were open. He was not breathing. She and her team concluded rapidly that Alex could not be resuscitated. Mr. Radita was present in the bedroom with the EMS personnel throughout.

[110]      Ms. Baumback spoke to Mr. Radita concurrent with her declaration that Alex was dead at 10:16 p.m. She asked Mr. Radita several questions about Alex. Mr. Radita told her that his son had been diagnosed with diabetes approximately one month prior by a doctor they had taken him to and Alex was on two types of insulin. He said Alex had had diarrhea for a month also. Mr. Radita told her he had last seen Alex alive the day before when he helped him to the bathroom. He said he had come home at 6:00 p.m. and Alex was then as Ms. Baumback saw him now. Mr. Radita had waited for the Church to come over and then called EMS. Ms. Baumback felt the death was suspicious. She called the police who had already been notified and the Medical Examiner’s Office.

[111]      Constable Pugliese of the Calgary Police Service was the first officer to arrive at the home at approximately 10:10 p.m. A member of the EMS team took him from Alex’s bedroom outside to the sidewalk where she advised him Alex was “beyond hope”.

[112]      Const. Pugliese asked the 20 or so people standing on the driveway who lived in the residence and Mr. Radita identified himself. He interviewed him briefly and then took him inside the house and into the kitchen. In answering his questions Mr. Radita told Const. Pugliese that Alex was a diabetic and that there was insulin in the fridge. He said he had delayed calling EMS from 6:00 p.m. when he returned home until 10:00 p.m. because Alex did not want medical treatment.

[113]      Const. Pugliese then gathered the balance of the Radita family to interview them in the kitchen. He interviewed Mrs. Radita at approximately 10:40 p.m. She told him Alex had had the flu for the past three days and diarrhea had started one month ago but had stopped and then returned three days ago. She told him Alex had a yeast infection in his throat which restricted his eating so she was feeding him baby formula and baby food. She had tried milk but it had upset his stomach.

[114]      The Medical Examiner, Shawna Mitchell, arrived at the home while Const. Pugliese was interviewing the family. After she examined Alex, at approximately 11:10 p.m., she interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Radita while Const. Pugliese was in the room. This interview took place in an upstairs bedroom beside the room Alex was in.

[115]      Mrs. Radita told Ms. Mitchell that she had checked Alex during the day and his stomach was moving and he was breathing. Mr. Radita said he had not called EMS earlier than he did because Alex refused as he had a bad experience when he was three years old.

[116]      Mrs. Radita said Alex did not have any medical issues. Const. Pugliese then repeated what Mr. Radita had already told him about the diabetes and insulin. Mrs. Radita then replied that he had been given that diagnosis at three years old and that he did take insulin but she did not believe the diagnosis but gave him the insulin anyway.

[117]      Shawna Mitchell also gave evidence in this trial. She confirmed her attendance at the Radita’s home, her assessment of Alex and her interview with the Radita parents while Const. Pugliese was present.

[118]      Mrs. Radita told her that Alex had been ill for one month with diarrhea and had developed a yeast infection three days prior. Prior to the months before his death he was a normal child. Mrs. Radita said Alex did not have diabetes but that he was sensitive so she wasn’t giving him any sugar and he took no medication. They both confirmed to her Alex did not have a family doctor. Each of Mr. and Mrs. Radita gave a different version as to when they had last seen Alex alive. Mr. Radita said he found Alex not breathing at 6:00 p.m. that day while Mrs. Radita said he was breathing at that time.

[119]      The police seized many items from the home including a garbage bag full of used diapers which underscores the length of time Alex must have been incontinent. Baby food was found in the room where Alex lay.

[120]      There were two open vials of insulin in the fridge. Insulin is viable for only 30 days after being opened. Without knowing the date this insulin was opened it is not possible to know if it was viable. There were numerous test strips all of which had expired. There were two glucose monitors as described previously. There was a sharps container full of used syringes. There were also unused syringes. A Safeway pharmacy was listed as the source of the diabetic supplies.

[121]      Dr. Pacaud gave evidence on the pharmacy records and the diabetic supplies found in the home. She concluded that for a boy of Alex’s relative age on the dates mentioned, the supplies in 2011 would have covered him for adequate care in that year for 260 days, for 80 days in 2012 and no days in 2013. With respect to the testing on the glucose meters she concluded that if these were the only two meters in use the frequency of testing was below the standard of care, the high readings required extra insulin and extra testing, neither of which was evident from the testing on the meters. The testing that was done was insufficient to keep Alex safe.

[122]      Dr. Pacaud was also able to make other conclusions based on Alex’s autopsy report, the diabetic supplies found in the home, and her review of Alex’s pharmacy and Alberta Health care records. Dr. Pacaud determined that Alex had been denied proper access to medical care and proper care for his diabetes. The absence of laboratory test records and medical visits meant Alex had received no medical care while in Alberta. Alex could not have received sufficient insulin for proper treatment of his disease. His percentile for height and weight at less than the fifth percentile confirmed that he had not received enough insulin for a long period of time. A minimum amount of insulin is required for a diabetic child to have proper growth.

[123]      As a result of not receiving sufficient insulin, Alex was also denied proper nutrition. This was underscored by his height and weight at death but is also evident in the photos from his last birthday held on or about January 30, 2013. She felt his presentation in these photos made it clear that he required medical attention at this time. Dr. Pacaud pointed out his visible emaciation, his lack of subcutaneous fat tissue, lack of muscle mass, and numerous visible bed sores as evidence of his severe malnutrition at this time.

[124]      Dr. Pacaud confirmed that the Raditas had failed to seek medical care for Alex when he showed obvious signs of illness, persistent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar readings), weight loss, stunted growth, sallow complexion and severe skin wounds and infections.

[125]      Dr. Pacaud found that the decubitus ulcers (bed sores) on Alex’s body were profound. Dr. Pacaud testified that a child with high blood sugar who is poorly controlled is more susceptible to infections and bed sores. Dr. Pacaud noted the neck wound had progressed so far that part of the jawbone was visible and there were darks spots consistent with necrosis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were absent. Dr. Pacaud found that this wound would have taken weeks or months to get to this point. The ulcers would have been painful. His hunger would have been unpleasant. He would have had decreased quality of life. She confirmed the autopsy report that Alex had died from an overwhelming infection in the context of severe malnutrition.

K.   Autopsy Report
[126]      An autopsy of Alex was completed by Dr. Jeffery Gofton on May 8, 2013. He gave evidence in this trial and was qualified as an expert in forensic pathology. Dr. Gofton confirmed that Alex was a Type 1 diabetic. He further confirmed Alex’s weight of 17 kilograms and height of 126 cm put him in the 0.1 percentile for his group for Body Mass Index (BMI). Alex’s overall appearance was skeletal, eyes sunken, with teeth rotted to the gum line. His emaciated appearance was not attributable to a post mortem process.

[127]      Alex’s body was covered in ducubitus ulcers or pressure sores also known as bed sores, with 41 on his trunk and limbs and three additional ulcers on his head and neck.

[128]      Dr. Gofton was unable to date the bed sores and while he noted that it is possible that some could have occurred within the minutes or hours before death the testing of other of the bed sores indicated a longer time frame. From his testing he could say that some of the bed sores showed chronic inflammation in the deeper layers with the presence of hemosederin which can be at least 18 hours old but also can mean that it has been present for weeks or months.

[129]      Alex did not die of DKA but rather of bacterial sepsis, here staphylococcus aureus, that overwhelmed his body. Due to neglect and starvation his body simply had no ability to mount a response to survive.

[130]      Dr. Gofton was able to conclude that Alex suffered from starvation due to his severely low BMI, lack of fat, lack of muscle mass and emaciated appearance.

[131]      Dr. Gofton was further able to conclude that Alex was also a victim of neglect as a result of:

1.      the multiple bed sores, over 40, in different locations and in different stages of healing with some being superficial and others very deep and expansive;

2.      there was no evidence of any treatment of the bed sores but for a piece of gauze on the right lower leg;

3.      there was no evidence of debridement of any wound;

4.      the large neck wound required immediate medical attention, if not surgery;

5.      the state of Alex’s teeth as previously indicated, were rotten in place;

6.      there was no record of care for Alex’s diabetes.

[132]      Dr. Gofton opined that it would have taken weeks for Alex to get to the point at which he died. He was clear that Alex’s appearance and bed sore testing illustrated a chronic process, an ongoing process. With Dr. Gofton’s review of Alex’s medical history in British Columbia he was of the opinion that the process had been going on for years.

[133]      Dr. Gofton could not give a precise time of death but thought it was within 24 to 36 hours prior to Deborah Baumback’s pronouncement of death at approximately 10:00 p.m. on May 7, 2013.

III.            Essential Fact Finding
[134]      From this review of the accepted trial evidence I find the following essential facts:

                              1.            Alex was a Type 1 diabetic first diagnosed in December 2000, which condition did not change throughout his life.

                              2.            Alex required insulin injections on a daily basis in order to survive.

                              3.            Mr. and Mrs. Radita understood that many doctors and much testing had confirmed this diagnosis. Mr. and Mrs. Radita had been told that testing had been done for other causes of Alex’s illness and that nothing else had been found.

                              4.            At the very latest by January 2008, Mr. and Mrs. Radita were fully trained and competent to perform Alex’s diabetic treatment. They knew how to administer finger pokes, use the glucose meter and test strips to test blood sugar; that a low blood sugar reading meant Alex was required to ingest a fast acting sugar, that a high blood sugar meant Alex required insulin. They understood the type and amount of insulin Alex required and if they were unsure they knew they could call a diabetic hotline or attend at any hospital emergency room. Mr. and Mrs. Radita understood that the food Alex ate impacted his blood sugar reading.

                              5.            Mr. and Mrs. Radita had been told and understood that Alex was required to attend periodic appointments with medical personnel so that his insulin needs could be monitored and adjusted as he developed.

                              6.            Alex had been to the emergency room of SMH twice before, near death, in 2000 and 2003. On both occasions after proper diabetic treatment he recovered and was able to be discharged. On both occasions Mr. and Mrs. Radita were present throughout and witnessed Alex’s recovery.

                              7.            Mr. and Mrs. Radita understood that Alex had been apprehended by the Ministry and placed in foster care because they had failed to administer the proper diabetic treatment for Alex as prescribed by his doctor. They understood that the doctors believed Alex had become extremely ill as a result of their actions.

                              8.            Mr. and Mrs. Radita understood that if they enrolled Alex in a school or took him to a doctor his diabetes control and medical condition would be monitored by others.

                              9.            Alex rarely left the Radita’s home in NW Calgary and when he did he was always in the company of one or more members of his family. Alex had no contact with or social life outside his immediate family members.

                          10.            Mr. and Mrs. Radita intended to and did isolate Alex from anyone who could intervene or monitor his insulin treatment aside from themselves.

                          11.            Sometime after they moved Alex to Alberta Mr. and Mrs. Radita intentionally began a program of providing Alex with just enough insulin so that he did not develop DKA or Kwashiorkor but not a sufficient amount to appropriately treat his diabetes and allow him to maintain healthy growth as a child.

                          12.            Alex died as a result of bacterial sepsis brought on by extreme starvation. His physical condition at death was not a sudden or quick occurrence but rather took place over months and possibly, probably, years.

                          13.            For reasons that are not known Mr. and Mrs. Radita never accepted Alex’s diagnosis of diabetes. They did however understand the proper insulin treatment and they understand the consequences to Alex of not following a proper insulin protocol and not providing him with medical care.
