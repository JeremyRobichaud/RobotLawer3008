[5]           On October 12, 2016, the appellant, Ms. Fox, went to the Canadian Tire store in Oromocto, New Brunswick, and removed a lure from its box.  The appellant was caught on video removing the item from its packaging, concealing it and leaving the store.  She was identified on the video and subsequently served with an information.  Although the pre-printed portion of the information dated March 21, 2017, was in both official languages, the charge itself was written only in English.

[6]           On May 4, 2017, at the time of her first appearance before the court, the record shows and the prosecution acknowledges that the appellant was not informed by the judge of her right to have the proceedings conducted in the language of her choice and nevertheless entered a plea of not guilty when asked by the judge.  At trial, where she changed her plea before another judge, no issue was raised as to the accusedâ€™s choice of language of proceedings.
