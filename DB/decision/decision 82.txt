V.        Conclusion

 

[67]           This Court denies the Applicant’s application. The Applicant has failed to meet his onus. All four charges against the Applicant contained in the May 31, 2010 indictment will be tried together.

 

[68]           As this Court noted during counsels’ oral submissions, this decision does not exhaust the Applicant’s opportunity to make a further application to sever some of the charges. He may make further severance applications where new circumstances arise during the trial process that warrant a re-examination of this issue.
