The Law
[15]           The sections of the Criminal Code relevant to the sentencing of Amal follow:

718 Purpose - The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of the just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:

(a)        to denounce unlawful conduct;

(b)        to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;

(c)        to separate offenders from society, where necessary;

(d)      to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

(e)        to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and

(f)        to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

718.01 Objectives - Offences Against Children - When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involves the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.

718.1 Fundamental Principle - A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

718.2 Other Sentencing Principles - A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(ii.i) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,

(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,

(iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation,

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.
