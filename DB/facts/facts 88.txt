[1]               In a written decision reported as R v Vader, 2016 ABQB 505 [“Vader”], and issued September 15, 2016, I found Travis Edward Vader [“Mr. Vader” or “Travis Vader”] guilty of and entered convictions for the second degree murder of Lyle and Marie McCann. The defence filed a notice of appeal the following day and on September 22nd filed an application asking that the Court vacate the guilty verdicts and declare a mistrial based on the erroneous application of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 230. The appeal was abandoned on October 12, 2016; the mistrial application was maintained.

[2]               On October 3, 2016, I directed the parties to exchange written submissions and that a consolidated set of briefs be sent to me in electronic form. On October 12, 2016, the defence ignored my direction and filed a written brief with the Clerk. At the Crown’s request, I gave Mr. Finlayson, Q.C., permission to provide his response brief directly to me. Mr. Whitling has apologized to the Court for the mistaken filing of the first defence brief.

[3]               The Crown responded to the mistrial application asking that it be dismissed and put forward other remedies to correct my legal error, including the vacation of the murder findings and the substitution of manslaughter verdicts.

[4]               I heard oral submissions on October 31, 2016, where I immediately accepted that Mr. Vader was incorrectly found guilty of second degree murder based on Criminal Code, s 230. After hearing argument, I vacated my findings that Mr. Vader is guilty of second degree murder and the related convictions and substituted verdicts of guilty on the lesser and included offenses of manslaughter in the killing of Lyle and Marie McCann, near Peers, Alberta, on or about July 3, 2010. Convictions on those substituted verdicts were also entered that day.

[5]               These are my written reasons on the mistrial application and the substituted verdicts/convictions.
