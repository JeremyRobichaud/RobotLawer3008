Outline of Complainant’s Evidence

 

[2]                           The Defendant is the step father of E.C.  The Defendant married E.C.’s mother when E.C. was five years old.  In the spring and summer of 2013, E.C., her mother, step brother and the Defendant lived in Stratford, PEI in a two story home with a basement.  E.C. who was aged about 20 at the time, used the basement rec room as her bedroom.  E.C. had gotten a part-time job at a local retail store that spring and had just gotten a second job - a seasonal full-time job.

 

[3]                           According to E.C., on the day of the alleged offence, E.C. had a shower in the bathroom and walked downstairs into her bedroom.  The Defendant came downstairs and walked into her bedroom while E.C. was not dressed, but still wearing just a towel.  He told E.C. she had to quit her part-time job at the retail store, because she now had a better full-time seasonal job.  She thought she could handle both.  He said you need to quit [store].  She did not want to, and the two had a five to ten minute discussion. He grabbed her by the throat, put her on her bed, sat beside her, choking her and saying “you need to quit!”  E.C. was afraid.  She said okay, she would quit the [store].  She called the store on her cell phone and quit on the spot.  The Defendant left the basement, and E.C. got dressed.  There was no other witness to the alleged assault.
