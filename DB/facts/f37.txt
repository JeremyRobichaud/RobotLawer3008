The July 26 incident at Fortune

[2]               The current matters have as their genesis the assault and uttering threats on and against Rodney Buffett, at Fortune, on July 26, 2013. The reasons for convicting the accused, as well as the facts of the matter, are reported at R. v. Conway (Reid), 2014 CanLII 11924 (NL PC). In brief, the accused threatened to kill Buffett, and assaulted him, which assault included biting the man on the back.

[3]               During the trial, the complainant actually pulled up his shirt and showed the mark left on his back from where the accused bit him. During the sentencing submissions, Crown counsel said that Buffett has been left with a “serious” scar on his back. Notwithstanding the apparently permanent scar to Buffett’s back, the Crown prosecuted the accused by summary conviction for a common assault.

[4]               The pre-sentence report is comprehensive. At pages 4 & 5, it describes the antecedents of the accused as follows:

A check with the RCMP, Provincial Court and Provincial Corrections records revealed the accused to have a criminal record dating back to 2007, which includes the following offences: assault x 2; uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm x 3; possessing property obtained by crime x 3; fraud x 1; theft under x 3; mischief relating to property x 1; dangerous operation of a motor vehicle x 1; failure to attend court x 2; failure to comply with probation order x 9; and failure to comply with undertaking x 10.

[5]               At page 5 of the report, we also learn that the accused was placed on supervised probation on September 25, 2012, for a period of eighteen months.  His supervisory period began upon the expiration of sentencing on December 24, 2012, and will expire on June 23, 2014. The fact that he was on probation, and therefore specifically required to keep the peace and be of good behavior, when he assaulted and threatened Rodney Buffett is a seriously aggravating factor on sentence: see R. v. Rowe, 2008 NLCA 3, R. v. Kelly, 2014 NLCA 9, and R. v. Strowbridge, 2014 NLCA 4.

[6]               The accused claims to have acted in self defence when he threatened and assaulted the complainant. At page 7 of the pre-sentence report, the following is noted:

Regarding the present matters before the court, the accused acknowledges there was an altercation between him and the victim.  Though he recognizes he reacted in the wrong manner, he believes the victim to have been the “provoker” and he was only defending himself.

[7]               It is clear that the accused has prior convictions for assault and for uttering threats, and also for breaching undertakings and probation orders. It is also clear that he does not accept responsibility for the offences committed on July 26, 2013 at Fortune.
