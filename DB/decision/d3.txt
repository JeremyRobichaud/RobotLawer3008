Conclusion

[60]   As the case law I reviewed earlier has established, a murder committed on a sudden impulse and without prior consideration, even though intentional, is not a planned murder. And a first degree murder must not only be planned it must also be deliberate. I find on a review of the whole of the evidence there is no evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict for first degree murder by way of either of the routes to murder – section 229(a)(i) or section 229(a)(ii). The evidence does not support the drawing of the inferences being sought by the Crown for first degree murder. They are not within “the field of inferences that could be reasonably drawn…” (Hawley, paragraph 10) Accordingly, I discharge Mr. Steele on the charge of first degree murder and commit him to stand trial for the second degree murder of Neema Barati.
