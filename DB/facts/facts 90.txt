[7]               The evidence shows that Eastgaard had signed agreements with the police to act as their agent to investigate, gather evidence and testify in criminal proceedings related to the deaths of three individuals.  His active work on those investigations, “Operation Desino”, started in July, 2012, shortly after being released from the penitentiary and being placed on parole.  It was on September 7, 2012, during Eastgaard’s work as a police agent on Operation Desino, that Eastgaard advised his police handlers that after meeting and speaking with Trong that day, he believed that the accused Trong was planning and intending to murder Vinh on September 9, 2012.

[8]               Shortly after hearing of Trong’s plan, another distinct investigation was launched by the Calgary Police Service into the alleged plot and conspiracy to kill Vinh which the CPS labelled “Operation Circumvent.”  As shown by the charges, it is the Crown theory that Trong, Henry and Balla, conspired to commit murder or cause Vinh to be murdered, with the intended crime to be committed on September 9, 2012. 

[9]               The evidence tends to show that Trong and Henry, at the relevant time, were upper level members of a Calgary-based gang called Fresh Off the Boat or FOB.  Balla was identified as an FOB associate or possible or potential FOB member.  The target of the alleged plot or their conspiracy to murder was Vinh, a member of a rival gang called Fresh Off the Boat Killers or FK.  Trong and Vinh had prior dealings with each other.  Trong was found guilty of discharging a firearm with intent, the offence date being July 6, 2006.  Vinh, allegedly a member of the FK, testified as a Crown witness at his trial.  Trong was sentenced to six years.  In 2007, Vinh discharged a firearm with the intent to wound targeting two other members of the FOB.  As will be shown in the survey of relevant evidence led during the preliminary inquiry, Vinh was sentenced for that crime on December 14, 2012.

[10]           There were numerous references in the testimony and in the intercepted communication evidence showing Trong and other members and associates of the FOB had motive to murder Vinh.  The motive evidence does not appear to be contentious in the preliminary hearing.  It is not included in the survey of admissible evidence.

[11]           Eastgaard testified he was a past member of the FOB, formerly an FOB enforcer and drug trafficker.  He admitted to assassinating an FK member and being involved in two other murders, as directed by the FOB.  He testified that in the summer and fall of 2012, he was pretending to be still involved in the gang lifestyle and was attempting to get close to senior members of the FOB as part of his arrangement with the police and his work as a police agent in Operations Desino and Circumvent.

[12]           The witnesses and evidence in the Preliminary Inquiry included: the police agent Eastgaard, the primary police investigator on Operation Circumvent, members of the agent (Eastgaard) handling team, surveillance team officers, also referred to as Strike Force, and other CPS officers; transcripts and recordings of the judicially authorized intercepted conversations, (one-party authorization), obtained pursuant to s. 184.2 Criminal Code, between Eastgaard and the three accused; and preliminary inquiry evidence tendered in accordance with s. 540(7) Criminal Code.

September 7, 2012
[13]             Trong contacted Eastgaard and wanted to see and talk to him.  The police directed him to make the contact as part of Operation Desino.  Initially, Trong and Eastgaard met at the Sunnyside CTrain station.

[14]           Later that day, Trong and Eastgaard met up again, Trong picking him up near McMahon Stadium.  Surveillance evidence shows Trong and Eastgaard were seen in a black Toyota Matrix, with Trong driving and Eastgaard as a passenger eastbound on 16 Avenue through Centre Street at 1651 hours.  At 1720 hours the Toyota Matrix was going northbound on Garden Road just off of Highway 1 or 17 Avenue.

[15]           It was during this drive that Eastgaard testified Trong stated he knew where Vinh was going to be on Sunday (September 9).  Trong told Eastgaard that he had information from Roland Chin, or Chin’s dad that Sunday was the anniversary of the death of Vinh’s drug kid (associate or underling) and that Vinh would be visiting the grave site that day.  Trong drove Eastgaard to the Mountain View cemetery east of Calgary.

[16]           Although Eastgaard could not testify as to the exact words used by Trong, he testified the two of them discussed and planned to murder Vinh on the Sunday.  Specifics were discussed.  The shooter would be in a “gun ship”.  The shooter was to be Eastgaard.  The spotter, Trong being the only one who knew what Vinh looked like, would be in another vehicle.  Although it was Trong’s plan, he sought advice from Eastgaard, who gave it.  They looked at entrances and exits in the cemetery so that the spotter would be properly placed to execute the plan.

[17]           Eastgaard testified that the planned murder of Vinh was “just a kind of loosely left plan” or a “fast-made plan.”  He also stated that Trong discussed waiting for a year, to the next anniversary of the death of the kid, to murder Vinh, as there may not be enough time this year to properly plan the murder.

[18]           While Eastgaard believed he was at the cemetery for at least half an hour, a surveillance officer’s notes records that the two were at the cemetery for approximately five minutes.  Thereafter, Trong and Eastgaard drove to Langdon.

[19]           Later that day Trong asked Eastgaard to contact Henry (also referred to as “Cock” in the intercepted conversations) and have him meet them at a downtown Calgary restaurant-pub called Brewsters.  Trong and Eastgaard drove to Brewsters in downtown Calgary were they met with Henry and Balla (also referred to as Byron in the intercepted conversations).  There was no discussion of the plan to murder Vinh during that meeting of the three accused and Eastgaard.

[20]           Shortly before 2000 hours, Henry drove Eastgaard to an area in Calgary close to his halfway house and dropped him off.  Eastgaard understood Henry was returning to Brewsters as he had ordered food.

September 8, 2012
[21]           On September 8, Eastgaard was instructed by the police to once again meet with Trong that day.  The police had been told by Eastgaard about Trong’s conversation with him on September 7 and Trong’s to murder Vinh.

[22]           Eastgaard met Trong at the Safeway in Kensington.  Trong was with another male.  The male left stating he would get the information right away.  According to Eastgaard, Trong stated the information he was getting was Vinh’s kid’s (deceased drug associate’s) name.  Eastgaard testified “then he told me that Henry was down - - down to do this with us” which Eastgaard understood meant that Trong had spoken with Henry and that the three of them were part of the plan to shoot Vinh on September 9.

[23]           Eastgaard testified that Trong stated that Eastgaard or Henry could be the shooter, or vice versa.  Eastgaard understood that Trong’s role would continue to be the spotter.

[24]           When Eastgaard mentioned to Trong that his Sunday curfew was 1800 hours, according to Eastgaard, Trong stated that Byran (Balla) would take Eastgaard’s place (role) and participate in the shooting of Vinh if Eastgaard was no longer available.

[25]           Eastgaard then suggested Trong drive him to the North Hill Mall.  The two went into a store and Trong purchased black Nike track pants, a black toque and a black sweater for Eastgaard.  Eastgaard understood that he was to wear these clothes on Sunday at the shooting of Vinh.  The clothes could then be quickly disposed of, to get rid of any gunshot residue resulting from the shooting of Vinh.  Neither Trong nor Eastgaard specifically spoke about the purpose of the clothing purchase, although during his testimony Eastgaard noted that he typically wore higher end clothing.

[26]           When Trong and Eastgaard parted, he understood that Trong would text him “ya” if the shooting was “a go”.  “That was our plan, to say – he was going to let me know if - - if I had to get up and get ready for Sunday morning to shoot at Fat Vinh.  To shoot to kill Fat Vinh.”  Trong would pick up Eastgaard early on Sunday September 9, 2012 and then they would go to the cemetery and get “everything ready.”

[27]           Trong, operating a 2004 Audi 6, licence plate BGL 2849, dropped Eastgaard off at his halfway house at 1757 hours.  Later on September 8, Eastgaard received a text from Trong stating “ya” which he understood meant that the plan to murder Vinh was going ahead.  This information was passed on to Eastgaard’s police handling team by Eastgaard.

[28]           Trong was observed by surveillance on September 8, after dropping off Eastgaard, driving the same vehicle at 1818 hours and after.  Trong picked up a male, identified as KB and then had what appeared to be a discussion or meeting with KB in a city playground.  They got back into Trong’s Audi and drove from Calgary to Mountain View cemetery at 1941 hours, the same cemetery that was visited by Trong and Eastgaard on September 7.  Trong and his passenger then drove west into a loop of Mountain View Cemetery and eventually to another nearby cemetery - Rocky View Cemetery.  Shortly thereafter, Trong’s Audi drove in tandem with a Toyota Corolla, back into Mountain View Cemetery at 2020 hours, where the vehicles parked and Trong, his passenger and two unidentified Asian males got out of the vehicles and were seen to walk into the cemetery grounds.  The surveillance report suggested the conduct of the group, or at least some of them, appeared to show they were looking at grave stones.

[29]           After approximately twenty minutes, Trong and the three others walked back toward the two vehicles and at 2052 hours both vehicles drove away in tandem out of the Mountain View Cemetery.

[30]           At 2101 hours, police surveillance believed that Trong was conducting some “capture surveillance” as he stopped and appeared to watch traffic, suggesting he wanted to detect if police were following him.

[31]           At approximately 2100 hours, two detectives drafted a Duty to Warn.  Later that evening, police served that Duty to Warn on Vinh.  The document advised Vinh in writing that the CPS had reliable information that he may be at risk and that his safety may be jeopardized, potentially resulting in serious injury or death. 

September 9, 2012
[32]            Early in the morning on September 9, 2012, Eastgaard was taken by the police from his halfway house and into custody for a parole violation.  The police intention was to remove Eastgaard from this “potential threat” or plan to murder Vinh, being carried out.  There was no contact between Eastgaard and any of the accused that day.

[33]           Surveillance was set up to monitor Trong at his residence.  While an attempt was made by the Strike Force Team to follow Trong, the team lost track of him.  Subsequently, police methods determined that Trong’s cell phone was in the vicinity of Hunterhorn Plaza.

[34]           The Strike Force attended at the Hunterhorn Plaza in NE Calgary in the early afternoon, and located Trong’s motor vehicle, an Audi A6, bearing licence plate BGL 2849.  While watching Trong’s vehicle, a Toyota Camry pulled into the parking lot, driven by Trong.  Trong exited the driver’s side and Henry exited the passenger side.  The two individuals got into Trong’s vehicle and drove away.  Surveillance showed that Trong then dropped Henry off at his apartment and Trong drove to a Safeway store in downtown Calgary.  He met with two unknown individuals in the grocery store and then re-entered his vehicle and drove to his residence in NW Calgary.

[35]           At 1353 hours, shortly after Trong and Henry exited the Toyota Camry, and left the parking lot in Trong’s Audi, Detective Vermette located the same Toyota Camry bearing AB licence plate BHF 1385 in the Hunterhorn Plaza parking lot.  He found and seized one latex glove located on the ground by the driver’s side door of the vehicle and seized a second latex glove on the ground beside the front passenger door of the vehicle.

[36]           The plate on the Toyota Camry was registered to a 1994 Acura Integra.  The registered owner of the plate was not the registered owner of the Toyota Camry.  Another plate was viewed under the passenger seat of the vehicle.  A binocular case was located on the floor behind the front driver’s seat.

[37]           The Toyota Camry was seized by Detective Vermette and towed from the Hunterhorn parking lot location.

[38]            Vinh was not murdered or injured by Trong, Henry or Balla or anyone else on September 9, 2012.

[39]           There were police conducting surveillance at the Mountain View Cemetery on September 9, 2012.  None of the three accused were seen at or near the cemetery, where Vinh’s kid was buried.

September 10, 2012
[40]           Eastgaard telephoned Henry from the Calgary Remand Centre to advise him that he was taken into custody on September 9, 2012 for a parole violation. 

September 11, 2012
[41]           Eastgaard was released from the Calgary Remand Centre.  After his release he got in contact with Trong by text message.  Eastgaard testified that there was some discussion, by text that Trong brought up “a fact of some car being towed” and that “some fact that there was heat that day” which Eastgaard understood to be comments about the plan to shoot Vinh.

September 12, 2012
[42]           On September 12, 2012, Detective Christie was assigned as the primary investigator for Operation Circumvent, the investigation into the allegation that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh and that Trong, Henry and Balla were members of that conspiracy.

September 19, 2012
[43]           An authorization to intercept private communications with consent pursuant to s. 184.2 of the Criminal Code was granted by Wong, PCJ.  Eastgaard was the “consenting person” and the named “principal known persons” whose private communications with Eastgaard authorized to be intercepted were the three accused: Trong, Henry and Balla.

[44]           A search warrant was executed on the Toyota Camry that was seen being driven by Trong, with Henry as a passenger on September 9, 2012.  A stolen licence plate was found underneath the passenger side seat – NEC 636.  No fingerprints were found on the stolen licence plate.  No fingerprints were found on the plate that was found on the Toyota Camry – BHF 1385.

September 26, 2012
[45]            Eastgaard met with Henry while wired to intercept their private communications.  According to the primary investigator, there were no discussions intercepted that were relevant or pertinent to the allegation that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh.

September 27, 2012
[46]            Eastgaard met with Henry while wired to intercept their private communications.  Once again, according to the primary investigator, there were no discussions intercepted that were relevant or pertinent to the allegation that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh.

October 3, 2012
Intercepted Communications with Trong Nguyen
[47]            Eastgaard met with Trong on October 3, 2012, while wired to intercept their private communications.  Portions of the digital recording device communications were identified by the police as being relevant or pertinent to the allegations made by Eastgaard.

[48]           Eastgaard testified that this meeting with Trong was the first time he had seen him since September 8. 

[49]           Some of the relevant intercepted communications are as follows:

Page 18, line 24 to page 20, line 13

Hans Eastgaard:         So what the fuck happened?  Why didn’t that other thing get done?

Trong Nguyen:            Hm?

Hans Eastgaard:         Why didn’t that other thing get finished?

Trong Nguyen:            Which thing?

Hans Eastgaard:         That other thing, when I got arrested, remember?

Trong Nguyen:            Oh, yeah.  It’s ‘cause the cops ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... um ... you didn’t talk to Cock about it?

Hans Eastgaard:         No. I don’t know if he knows or not.

Trong Nguyen:            Oh.  Yeah, didn’t get finished because the cops ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... they, they caught wind of it somehow and then they came, they showed up there that day and blocked off the entrance to the, the place, right?  Like we thought, okay, maybe this is like maybe it could be routine . . .

Hans Eastgaard:         Ah ...

Trong Nguyen:            ... once in a while.

Hans Eastgaard:         It could be routine, right?

Trong Nguyen:            No, that’s what I was thinking, right?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            There was three cop cars.  They were just posted up there and they were just mean mugging everybody that drives by.

Hans Eastgaard:         ‘Cause how would they catch wind?  There was me, you ...

Trong Nguyen:            The phone.  Roland’s dad and ... I’m not sure but I’m thinking ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... maybe Roland’s dad, maybe Roland.  Roland talks a lot.  Could be Roland saying something on the phone like with somebody to get the info to begin with.  ‘Cause Roland was the one that told his dad about it and his dad told those kids about it.

Page 22, lines 4 to 8

Trong Nguyen:            Like because they were just posted up there to prevent anything.  But like really, if they really knew ...

Hans Eastgaard:         So is that why they come and grip me then?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.  Probably, yeah.

Page 22, line 18 to page 23, line 16

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.  Uh, and then get ... like we borrowed like one of those kids’s cars...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... to do it so in the morning I met up with them and I took their car, like they, they left the car there and I took, I came and I took the car.  I left my car there.  We went, tried to go do it.  We were still gonna try and do it.  Um, oh, yeah, we were, we were trying to do it like without you.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            We went down there.

Hans Eastgaard:         ‘Cause I was like waiting just to read that.  I was like come on.

Trong Nguyen:            Read what?

Hans Eastgaard:         Well just to read something like that.  You know what I mean?

Trong Nguyen:            What?

Hans Eastgaard:         That ...

Trong Nguyen:            Oh, on (Indiscernible)

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.  Fuck, I was waiting to read it.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, they were, they were trying to prevent it.

Page 25, line 11 to page 27, line 5

Trong Nguyen:            Then afterwards I dropped off the car, like I went, I met up with those ... I dropped off the car, I picked up my car, I went and dropped Cock off or whatever and then uh, I met up with those guys to give ‘em the keys couple hours later to go to get the car and the car’s not there.

Hans Eastgaard:         (Laughs)

Trong Nguyen:            They’re like yo, where’s the car?  Like ...

Hans Eastgaard:         What do you mean the car’s not there?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Or that’s what you’re ...

Trong Nguyen:            I parked exactly ... yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         That’s what you texted me, right?  Remember that day you ...

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, that they took the car, right?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, I didn’t know what the fuck that meant.  I was just like what?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.  They, they came and they took the car within like a couple hours and then they kept it for like a couple weeks.  I don’t know if they even got it back yet.

Hans Eastgaard:         Wow.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.  So, yeah, that car was, vehicle was under uh, criminal investigation.

Hans Eastgaard:         Was there anything in it?

Trong Nguyen:            No.

Hans Eastgaard:         Okay, good.

Trong Nguyen:            Nothing but like when I got out, since nothing happened, I took my gloves off and shit and I just threw it on the ground.  (Laughs)

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, no.

Trong Nguyen:            Looks shady, right?

Hans Eastgaard:         Right out front?  Right out like the side of the car you mean?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, no.

Trong Nguyen:            No, but it was nothing.  Like it ... you know?

Hans Eastgaard:         Well did you ask him if ...

Trong Nguyen:            They’re just gloves.  That’s why they think something happened.  (Indiscernible).  That was stupid. (Indiscernible).

[50]           After the playing of the audio of this intercepted communication, and other intercepted communication, Eastgaard was asked by the Crown to explain the meaning of certain language used in the oral communications.

[51]           Eastgaard testified that he understood Trong to say that the police found out about his plan with others to shoot and murder Vinh; that Trong had borrowed a vehicle to use in the murder of Vinh; that even though Eastgaard was in custody on September 9, that Trong and others were going to try to execute the plan without him.

October 5, 2012
[52]           On October 5, 2012, Eastgaard was questioned and provided a second KGB statement, arising out of events that occurred on October 3, 2012 and during the week.  His agent handling team believed Eastgaard had lied during his October 3 KGB statement and that some information provided by him was after the completion of that KGB.

October 18, 2012
Intercepted Communications with Henry Nguyen
[53]             Eastgaard met with Henry on October 18, 2012, while wired to intercept their private communications.  Portions of the digital recording device communications were identified by the police as being relevant or pertinent to the allegations that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh.

[54]           Some of the relevant intercepted communications are as follows:

Page 18, line 19 to page 19, line 18

Hans Eastgaard:         But he’s like best friends with Byron.

Henry Nguyen:           Oh, yeah, I know that.

Hans Eastgaard:         Fuck, I can’t believe that.

Henry Nguyen:           I know, I know.  ‘Cause Byron sucks his dick and does everything he wants, even if it’s, even if he doesn’t like it or it’s not fair, you know?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Henry Nguyen:           Which is ... it’s good.  He’s loyal to Trong.  So it’s good for Trong.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, but I still can’t believe that he wanted him to come that day with us.

Henry Nguyen:           Oh, I know.  I know.  That, that I didn’t agree with.  That’s why when you didn’t show up I was like, yo, I was like no, no, no, no.  I was like you drive, I’ll go.

Hans Eastgaard:         You drive, I go, eh?

Henry Nguyen:           Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Henry Nguyen:           And he’s like, okay, sure.  Fuck, that’s the kind of shit that you don’t fuckin’ send me off with a kid, man.

Hans Eastgaard:         Well no shit.

Henry Nguyen:           And he’s, he’s like, yeah, yeah.

[55]           Eastgaard, after listening to the intercepted audio in Court, testified that he understood Henry’s statements to mean that Henry and Trong were still going through with the plan to murder Vinh on September 9, even though Eastgaard was in custody.  The references to “Byron” in the transcript are to the accused Byran Balla.

October 19, 2012
Intercepted Communications with Trong Nguyen
[56]           Eastgaard met with Trong, on October 19, 2012, while wired to intercept their private communications.  Portions of the digital recording device communications were identified by the police as being relevant or pertinent to the allegations made by Eastgaard.

[57]           Some of the relevant intercepted communications are as follows:

Page 6, line 24 to page 8, line 7

Hans Eastgaard:         Can I smoke in here?  You want one?  So I was with Cock yesterday.

Trong Nguyen:            Oh, yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.  He doesn’t like Byron too much, hey?

Trong Nguyen:            It’s ‘cause of his girl or whatever, right?

Hans Eastgaard:         Ah, he says he doesn’t trust him.

Trong Nguyen:            (Indiscernible) mad about (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         ‘Cause he that’s … remember …

Trong Nguyen:            Trust him about what?

Hans Eastgaard:         He doesn’t trust him.  He said that’s why he called it off that one day with Phat.

Trong Nguyen:            What?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            He called it off?

Hans Eastgaard:         That’s what he said to me, man.  I’m just …

Trong Nguyen:            Talk about he called it off?

Hans Eastgaard:         (Laughs) He said …

Trong Nguyen:            Wow.

Hans Eastgaard:         … because I didn’t show up that uh, you said that he can go with Byron and he felt like a kid so he called it off or something like that.

Trong Nguyen:            What?  No.

Hans Eastgaard:         I’m just telling you what he told me, right?

Trong Nguyen:            Fuckin’, yeah, we … yeah.  He said he wanted to do it with me instead or whatever so okay and then when we got there the reason why we couldn’t do it is … you know already.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            That’s why.  He didn’t call it off.

Hans Eastgaard:         (Laughs)

Trong Nguyen:            What’s he talking about?

[58]           Eastgaard testified that he understood Trong to be saying that Trong and Henry were still going to do the planned shooting and that it did not go ahead because of the police presence at the cemetery.

October 22, 2012
[59]            Eastgaard met with Henry while wired to intercept their private communications.  According to the primary investigator, there were no discussions intercepted that were relevant or pertinent to the allegation that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh.   

October 23, 2012
[60]           A newspaper article was published on October 23, 2012.  It stated, in part:

Vinh Truong pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm with intent to wound in connection with a Dec. 31, 2007 attack on two men outside a northwest home. . . .

The prosecutor said he and defence counsel Simon Lord will make a joint recommendation on sentencing.

[61]           The primary investigator instructed the agent handling team to provide Eastgaard with a copy of that article to stimulate conversation with Trong, Henry and Balla.

October 24, 2012
Intercepted Communications with Trong Nguyen
[62]           Eastgaard met with Trong on October 24, 2012, while wired to intercept their private communications.  Portions of the digital recording device communications were identified by the police as being relevant or pertinent to the allegations made by Eastgaard.

[63]           The digital recording came to an abrupt end and appears to have failed prior to the agent handling team disconnecting the device, so some communication may not have been recorded.

[64]           Eastgaard referred Trong to the newspaper article on Vinh’s guilty plea and discussed the date of the sentencing and the proposed joint recommendation by counsel.  Some of the relevant intercepted communications are as follows:

Page 5, line 11 to page 6, line 16

Trong Nguyen:            The newspaper.  It was like on uh ... I don’t know.  I read it on the Internet.  Said it was a joint submission.  See, prosecutor, defense counsel (indiscernible) recommendation on sentencing.  But (indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         I don’t want this.  That’s fucking bullshit.  Bullshit.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Well he’ll be safe for six more years. (Laughs)

Trong Nguyen:            I don’t know.

Hans Eastgaard:         Hey?

Trong Nguyen:            I don’t know.  At least we know where he is going to be on the 14th.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, but how are we going to do a court house?  Dude, that’s like worse than the airport.

Trong Nguyen:            Outside it though.

Hans Eastgaard:         He’s ... you think he’s coming in?

Trong Nguyen:            He has to walk there.

Hans Eastgaard:         He’s in custody, isn’t he?

Trong Nguyen:            No.  He’s out on bail right now.  He’s on a house arrest.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, really?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, he’s on house arrest right now.

Hans Eastgaard:         Really?

Trong Nguyen:            It’s doable.

Hans Eastgaard:         It’s, it’s doable as long as it’s not inside, it’s doable.

Trong Nguyen:            (Indiscernible) doable.

Page 8, lines 10-16

Hans Eastgaard:         ‘Cause then we should fuckin’ ... you want to drive by there before we go eat?

Trong Nguyen:            Where?

Hans Eastgaard:         The court house.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, let’s go look around there actually.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            For sure.

Page 23, line 5 to page 24, line 20

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, so I think ... well either way he’s gonna be coming from here.  So let’s see where the cameras ... yeah, they’re pretty serious cameras too, you know?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, right there, for sure there is, eh?

Trong Nguyen:            But it is winter time.  You know what I mean?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, there’s one there, one there, one there.

Trong Nguyen:            Winter time people could be pretty uh, dressed pretty warm.

Hans Eastgaard:         One there.

Trong Nguyen:            Hoodie and mask.

Hans Eastgaard:         A hoodie, uh, a mask might be a little bit too overboard but ... oh, yeah, there’s even one right there too.

Trong Nguyen:            You know what?

Hans Eastgaard:         One right there too.  One ...

Trong Nguyen:            Know what?

Hans Eastgaard:         Holy fuck.

Trong Nguyen:            Get one of those quiet ones.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            Then it would be a lot easier.  You know what I mean?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, I know what you mean.

Trong Nguyen:            It would just be like shzzz.  Like, you know, nobody would even know.  All of a sudden this guy’s is whatever.

Hans Eastgaard:         Well it, it still ... people will know but ...

Trong Nguyen:            (Coughs)

Hans Eastgaard:         ... it won’t be ...

Trong Nguyen:            Won’t be as ser’, as uh, noticeable.

Hans Eastgaard:         No, it won’t be as noticeable.

                                    Not even close. (Laughs)

Hans Eastgaard:         Really?  Can people find that or what?

Trong Nguyen:            Like, yeah, my buddy has some right now.  I’ll, I’ll confirm it with him but ... yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         When does the fucking fag come back?

Trong Nguyen:            The 14th.

Hans Eastgaard:         Well then take a look at that.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.  I’ll look into it. (Indiscernible).

Page 29, line 9 to page 30, line 23

Hans Eastgaard:         That’s the only fuckin’ problem, right?

Trong Nguyen:            Right here?  This?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            It is risky.  It’s uh ... it’s not a ... it’s pretty uh ... it would take a lot of balls.  (Laughs)  Fuckin’ ...

Hans Eastgaard:         That’s the only way in though, is that one?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         No, we can’t go in uh ...

Trong Nguyen:            There’s two, there’s two, like there’s two doors there.  Like one on this side and one over there.

Hans Eastgaard:         One on ... so it’s all ...

Trong Nguyen:            One like at the corner and then one over, one over to the left more.

Hans Eastgaard:         And how close inside is the, the fuckin’, the fuckin’ faggots?

Trong Nguyen:            Uh, like the faggots are not really there.  It’s uh, just a bunch of like, you know, like the guys ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Security guys?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, yeah.  Those guys and they’re just there like, like to check people’s stuff.  It’s like not, not far in though.  Like it’s, you gotta go in, you gotta go through a door and then it’s like whole role of ‘em and there’s probably like five guys standing there but they’re all doing something.

Hans Eastgaard:         There not this though, are they?

Trong Nguyen:            I don’t think so.  Oh, I don’t know, maybe, but I don’t ...

Hans Eastgaard:         But if it’s quiet then, yeah, that would work, right?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, just walk by and hit him.  Don’t even (Indiscernible) don’t go like that, just ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... walk by and it would be like this, like, like that, you know?

Page 33, line 11 to page 34, line 12

Hans Eastgaard:         Can you just do one more lap?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, we should uh ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Do you want to get out?

Trong Nguyen:            Walk around there?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.  Actually, no, we shouldn’t.  No don’t.

Trong Nguyen:            We got a lot of time still like (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         I don’t know how long those are recorded, right?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, we should get this (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         We should what?

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, we should make sure that thing’s ready.  Like I can ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:            ... (Indiscernible) buddy (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Well work on that right away.

Trong Nguyen:            That’s like five Gs.

Hans Eastgaard:         That’s how much it costs?

Trong Nguyen:            Close to that, yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Wow.  It’s ... is it a more than one shot one?

Trong Nguyen:            Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Okay, perfect.

Trong Nguyen:            Yeah, it’s like a normal one.

Hans Eastgaard:         Not like those pop bottle ones?

Trong Nguyen:            No, fuck.  (Laughs)  No, this is the real deal.

Page 15, line 3 to page 16, line 7

Trong Nguyen:           Yeah.  Byron uh, fuckin’ Byron has a big mouth.

Hans Eastgaard:          He’s not as bad as Russia I don’t think.

Trong Nguyen:           No, fuck, Russia is just dumb.  Like Byron he’s okay when he’s not drinking and shit.

Hans Eastgaard:          Yeah, just when he’s drunk, eh?

Trong Nguyen:           Even then though like he, he’s got this thing, like he’s … he doesn’t know much, you know, so then like he comes out and then he tries to figure everything out really fast, you know.

Hans Eastgaard:          Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:           But then he gets really excited and he thinks he can cut corners by fuckin’ like try to gain respect by fuckin’ acting, or talking like he knows a lot of shit, you know?

Hans Eastgaard:           Yeah.

Trong Nguyen:           Saying names or whatever, you know?

Hans Eastgaard:          But do you think for like, okay, something like, like last plan, right?

Trong Nguyen:           Yeah, yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:          Would he be … do you think he would talk about it after though?

Trong Nguyen:           I think there’s a chance, yeah.  If he got drunk I think he would talk about it.

Hans Eastgaard:          Like details?

Trong Nguyen:           Maybe, no, maybe not details but he would uh …

Intercepted Communications with Henry Nguyen
[65]           On October 26, 2012, Eastgaard met with Henry while wired to intercept their private communications.  Portions of the digital recording device communications were identified by the police as being relevant or pertinent to the allegations that there was a conspiracy to murder Vinh.

Page 35, line 20 to page 38, line 12

Hans Eastgaard:         I try to stay away from everybody right now.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.  (Indiscernible) ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Ever since ...

Byran Balla:               That’s what I’ve been doing.

Hans Eastgaard:         Dude, ever since I got attested for that day for six o’clock ... dude, they came into my house at six o’clock in the morning and arrested me.

Byran Balla:               Wow.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.  And it was bullshit because you know what was supposed to happen that day.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Fuckin’ fatty was supposed ...

Byran Balla:               Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         ... to fuckin’ get it.

Byran Balla:               That’s another thing too.  That really tripped me out too.  There was something up with that too.  Hundred percent there was something up with that.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, I just think that ... well Trong told me that he thinks that Roland heated that out on the phone, right?

Byran Balla:               Well I think somebody did.  Somebody on that end anyway.

Hans Eastgaard:         And then they ...

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible) his dad.

Hans Eastgaard:         And then they probably think that I’m the hitter so they came and gripped me right away, right?

Byran Balla:               Just guessing (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Well I don’t know.  They obviously saw me ‘cause it ...

Byran Balla:               How did they get the car though too?  Like the car (Indiscernible) that was enough information ‘cause they went and, went and (Indiscernible) car.

Hans Eastgaard:         I don’t know.  I don’t know.  Trong told me that they seized some car or something like that.

Byran Balla:               Yeah, the car that we (Indiscernible) lent to us by one of those kids and just very clean, we never talked on the phone about it.  There was nothing on the phone about it from our end and we just left it in a parking lot and then (Indiscernible) ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Well obviously they were ...

Byran Balla:               … (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Obviously they were following us obviously.

Byran Balla:               Nah.  No way.  There’s no fuckin’ way.

Hans Eastgaard:         Dude, they said whenever ...

Byran Balla:               We ... they’d ... they weren’t sitting there.

Hans Eastgaard:         Dude, no, no, no, they weren’t sitting there obviously but what they said in my paperwork, they said that I was seen at a Safeway talking to somebody that I’m not supposed to but then they let me back out.  You know what I mean?

Byran Balla:               Mm.

Hans Eastgaard:         So I don’t know what the fuck is going on.

Byran Balla:               I know.  That’s one think I’ve always suspected too (Indiscernible) get out (Indiscernible) or whatever ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               ... (Indiscernible) I was pretty sure (Indiscernible) halfway through it ...

Page 41, line 1 to page 44, line 9

Hans Eastgaard:         But that pissed me off ‘cause that should still got done.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         But ... well I talked to Trong.  I know why it didn’t get done, you know?

Byran Balla:               We ... actually, you know what, we were, we were going and then they, they, they, they were setting up.  They had ... it was (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, I know because you know me and Trong went the day before and planned it all out, right?

Byron Balla:               Oh, yeah?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               Oh, yeah, it was sick.  It was perfect.  It ... that was great.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, but how did the fuckin’ police catch wind of it?  That’s the only ...

Byron Balla:               I don’t know.

Hans Eastgaard:         ... fuckin’ thing that scared me.

Byran Balla:               But it was a hundred percent sure they did because at first I seen ‘em on the ring road and then we seen ... well we seen ‘em from the corner and shit (Indiscernible).  And ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               ... I went to check it again and just drove by.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, you guys just couldn’t get a hold of me but it was still a go, eh?

Byran Balla:               It was still a go, yeah.  We went to do it.  We’re ... we went and ... yeah, it was going down.  And then we were sitting there for a couple hours and ...

Hans Eastgaard:         And then what?

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         The police just showed up or what?

Byran Balla:               No, they were there but we only seen it from the one side.  And then I was like, you know what, I think I’m gonna take a look around and (Indiscernible) car.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               And then we just went left on 84th to the ring road or whatever.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               And I go ... and then I seen these other, these two other cop cars from the other exit, the first exit, the one deeper in.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, really?

Byran Balla:               Two of them backed up in there and then the one that we seen from the road too on the other end of it. (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         (Indiscernible).

Byran Balla:               But for sure they were just sitting there waiting.

Hans Eastgaard:         (Indiscernible) ...

Byran Balla:               And ...

Hans Eastgaard:         ... fuckin’ fucked that fat fuck.

Byran Balla:               Yeah, I know.  And I don’t even think he ... I bet you they warned him, duty to warn and all that shit because if they did that, they knew something.  They knew a lot.

Hans Eastgaard:         Well do you think they just ...

Byran Balla:               They knew about the cemetery and they knew about the fuckin’ car too.  The car is the fuckin’ craziest part.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, I didn’t, I didn’t even know about the car.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.  Well I know, it was ... yo, they knew about the car too ‘cause they came and gripped it right from the parking lot.

Hans Eastgaard:         What happened?  Like they just towed it, eh?

Byran Balla:               Uh, yeah.  They, they ... yeah, they towed it and took it for investigation or something.  (Indiscernible)

Hans Eastgaard:         Have they give the car back yet?

Byran Balla:               Uh, I don’t know but I, I asked a couple weeks later and they still have it.

Hans Eastgaard:         Uh, you know you should ... if they give that car back you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna go near that car.

Byran Balla:               Oh, for sure.

Page 45, line 24 to page 46, line 20

Byran Balla:               So what ... I, I know it must have been ... it’s communication wise and it just ... I don’t know.  That’s why I think somebody is talking.

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, I, I don’t think anyone’s taking.  I think it was just somebody fuckin’ heated over that jail phone.

Byran Balla:               Yeah, somebody talking.  That’s what I mean.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible) yo, something to do ... yo, they knew the graveyard.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               They knew the car.   So they knew those two pieces of information.

Hans Eastgaard:         Like who knew?

Byran Balla:               But they didn’t know enough.  But yo ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Who knew about the car though?

Byran Balla:               I don’t ... well just me, Trong and Roland’s dad, uh, Shey and Shey un ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Who’s Shey?

Bryan Balla:               One of Roland’s kids.

Page 49, line 1 to page 52, line 5

Hans Eastgaard:         You heard when I got arrested, eh?

Byran Balla:               Yeah, I heard when you got arrested.  Yeah.  But the one you’re telling me about, right, that morning?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Byran Balla:               Yeah, I heard about it.  Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         And it’s ...

Byran Balla:               But ...

Hans Eastgaard:         ... fuckin’ bullshit.

Byran Balla:               Think ... no, I think they just talk too much on the phone and shit, you know?

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, but why would they ...

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         ... come grip me of all people?

Byran Balla:               No.

Hans Eastgaard:         ‘Cause ...

Byran Balla:               See th’, that I don’t understand.  Like, you know, was that a gamble?  Was that just a ... it kind’a seems like they were kind’a fishing on something.

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               Because to take the car in for investigation, if they actually knew what was happening they for sure didn’t know (Indiscernible).  They, they weren’t on us in the fuckin’ car.  Like yo, (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah.

Byran Balla:               Where we were sitting and everything like (Indiscernible) there’s no fuckin’ way.  There’s no way out.

Hans Eastgaard:         There is no way.

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible) could have rolled in and oh, what are you guys doing here?  You know, like ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Yeah, they would have pinched you ...

Byran Balla:               And they wouldn’t have (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         ... right at that cemetery.

Bryan Balla:               And other people were still (Indiscernible) and stuff.  There was a guy in a black TL but it wasn’t ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Is that kid, is that kid FK kid?  The guy at the cemetery?

Byran Balla:               What’s that?

Hans Eastgaard:         That guy’s an FK kid obviously, the guy at the cemetery, right?

Bryan Balla:               Yeah.  Well I, I’m guessing.  It was in that same ... ‘cause we never even found the exact ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Oh, you guys never found the exact (Indiscernible).

Bryan Balla:               No, we just kind’a knew the vicinity.  We knew it was right there but we looked and couldn’t find fuck ...

Hans Eastgaard:         Fuck, how long were you guys gonna wait there?  All day, eh?

Byran Balla:               Yeah, we sat there for a good ...

Hans Eastgaard:         I know.  I was supposed to stay with you ‘til six and then I was ... I gotta go back, right?  That was gonna be shitty.  (Laughs)

Byran Balla:               Yeah, well you know what that was ... it is shitty (Indiscernible).

Hans Eastgaard:         Well I know.  I fuckin’ get arrested.

Byran Balla:               It’s a good thing that ... you know what I mean?

Hans Eastgaard:         Well maybe good thing that they ...

Byran Balla:               (Indiscernible) very good thing that it didn’t go down.

Hans Eastgaard:         (Laughs)

Byran Balla:               Very good thing.  Not with that kind of shit, man.

Hans Eastgaard:         (Laughs)

Byran Balla:               That’s a little too close for comfort.

Hans Eastgaard:         No shit.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.

Hans Eastgaard:         Fuckin’ looking at life, twenty-five, that’d be shitty, man.

Byran Balla:               Yeah.  No, for sure.

[71]           Eastgaard testified that he understood Balla to be speaking about Sunday, September 9, 2012 and the plan to shoot and murder Vinh, and that when Balla referred to “us” he was referring to Trong, Henry and himself (Balla).  Eastgaard understood Balla to state that Balla, Trong and Henry went to the cemetery to kill Vinh; but that they saw the police.  Because of the police presence, the shooting of Vinh did not “go down” – was not attempted.
