•         Tran (the Applicant) and his wife Hoa Duong had been living separate and apart since November 2003.

 

•         Prior to November 2003, Tran and Duong shared an apartment with their two children.

 

•         Duong occupied a bedroom in the apartment separate from Tran.

 

•         Tran occupied the “master bedroom.”

 

•         The separate bedroom arrangement was an arrangement of six years.

 

•         Duong had a friendship with a male, An, since November 2002. The friendship evolved into a romantic relationship.

 

•         Tran became suspicious of Duong and used listening devices to listen to her telephone conversations.

•         During a telephone conversation Duong shared with An, Duong knew that Tran was listening in because she heard her children’s voices.


•         Tran confronted Duong and asked her if she knew this man (An).

 

•         Duong discovered a device connected to the telephone she used to talk with An.

 

•         Duong and the children moved from the apartment in November 2003.

 

•         In early January 2004, Tran moved from the apartment and Duong returned to the apartment with the children.

 

•         Duong continued to occupy the same bedroom she had previously occupied. One of the children occupied the “master bedroom.”

 

•         Duong saw Tran drive around and around the house she moved to in November 2003.

 

•         Tran asked Duong to come back to him.  Tran told Duong that if she did not come back to him, their son Daniel would not see twenty.

 

•         The tires on An’s car were slashed in October or November, 2003.

 

•         On December 29, 2003, the brake line on An’s car was cut, causing the car to have no braking action.

 

•         On December 30, 2003, An reported the cut to his brake line to the police.

 

•         After An’s tires were slashed, Duong told Tran not to do anything stupid. After An’s brake line was cut Duong and An did not trust Tran.

 

•         Duong told Tran she wanted to see a lawyer about a divorce. Tran got mad.

 

•         Tran paid maintenance for the two children. Tran provided a letter for Duong so she could receive a rent reduction.

 

•         Tran came to the apartment to visit the children in January and February 2004.  Tran would advise Duong when he was coming so Duong could leave.

 

•         Tran returned to Duong all keys to the apartment and security access cards.

 

•         Tran continued to receive his mail at the apartment after he left and he would seek access to the building from the apartment manager or by following tenants.

 

•         On Sunday, February 9, 2004, Tran came to the apartment to visit the children.

 

•         The telephone in the apartment had a call display feature which would show callers’ telephone numbers.


•         On Monday, February 10, 2004, An came to the apartment with Duong. An parked his car away from the building, at a nearby grocery store.  An said to Duong that he did not want to park in front of her apartment because “Kham (Tran) maybe go around and he don’t want to  - his car park right at [her] apartment.” The children were at school.

 

•         The telephone rang when An was at the apartment. The call was from a number that Duong did not recognize. Duong did not answer the telephone.

 

•         About a half hour after the telephone call, the door of the apartment opened. The door had been locked.

 

•         Duong and An were in Duong’s bedroom. They were unclothed. Duong saw Tran at the bedroom door. Tran attacked An - kicking him, slapping his face and tried to get his eyeballs.

 

•         Tran ran to the kitchen and came back with two knives and stabbed An. An died.

 

•         Tran stabbed and cut Duong’s face.  He pulled Duong’s head up and said “are you beautiful?”

 

•         Tran put a knife in An’s hand when An was lying on the floor after being attacked.

 

•         Tran said to An, “I already got someone to do your car. Don’t you understand?”

 

•         An’s shoes were inside the entrance to the apartment.

 

•         Tran had to pass the first bedroom before he reached the bedroom where he found An and Duong.

 

•         After Duong returned to the apartment after being in the hospital where she was treated for her injuries, she noted a telephone call came to her apartment on February 10, 2004 at 12:33 p.m. from number 918-0622.

 

•         On February 10, 2004, the apartment manager saw Tran waving his hands. She allowed him to enter the building. He said he came to get his mail and that he had lost his key card. The apartment manager did not see where Tran went. He would have had access to the floor where Duong lived.

•         Tran did not seem to be angry, disturbed or agitated, nor did he appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. There was nothing about his behavior that forewarned the apartment manager about the events that then took place in his wife’s apartment suite.

 


•         Lobby security footage did not indicate that Tran was carrying any weapons in his hands as he passed through the front door and lobby area.

 

•         The apartment manager told Tran it was the last time that she would let him in.  She did not see Tran leave. About fifteen minutes later, an Oriental man asked her to call 911.

 

•         When Tran came to the apartment building on February 10, 2004, he parked his vehicle behind the building although there was short term parking provided in front of the building.

 

•         Some weeks before February 10, 2004, Tran had told a family friend (his godmother Hoa Ai Thai) that he had heard Duong talking on the phone with a man. Tran was upset and crying.

 

•         Tran later told Hoa Ai Thai that on February 9, 2004, he had telephoned his son and he was told that Duong was not at home. He said he went to the apartment and checked the telephone numbers on the telephone and he saw a number which he suspected was the number of Duong’s boyfriend.

 

•         Tran did not go to work on the morning of February 10, 2004. He saw Hoa Ai Thai and told her that he stayed up until 4 or 5 in the morning, that he talked to Duong’s girlfriend until midnight, that he was sad because he saw the telephone number and he did not know why he was not at home and why that guy phoned and talked to his wife. Tran said that when he went to work his supervisor sent him home because he did not look well and he might cause an accident.

 

•         Tran told Duong’s sister-in-law in November 2003, that he knew Duong’s boyfriend’s name.

 

•         On February 10, 2004, before he went to the apartment, Tran spoke to his godfather Minh Tran. He said he had not slept the night before which is why he was not at work. Tran seemed normal to Minh Tran.

 

•         Frankie Wong loaned his cellular phone to Tran on the morning of February 10, 2004, somewhere around 11:00 a.m., because Tran said his cellular telephone battery was low. Wong overheard Tran talking on the phone but did not understand what he was saying, as Wong believed Tran was speaking in Vietnamese. Wong’ telephone number is 918-0682.

 

 

•         After the phone call, Wong did not see Tran. About a half hour later Wong was told of the incident that had taken place at the apartment.

•         Tran was carrying a knife with him when he went to the apartment on February 10, 2004. He did not use that knife to attack An or Duong.
