6.             On February 24, 2018, Mr. Johnson got up around 8:00 or 8:30 a.m. and began work in the basement of his residence. Around 11:00 a.m. or noon, he was tired and suggested to his spouse to go for a drive in the vicinity of their camp to see if other people were there. He says that their camp is located on Desherbiers Road, approximately seven (7) or eight (8) miles from the paved road.



7.            Initially, Mr. Johnson said that they had left for a drive at about 3:00 or 3:30 p.m., without mentioning any travel before their departure. According to him, when they arrived at the camp, it was getting dark. He says that at about 9:30 p.m., they checked to see if any friends were at their camp and as there was no one there, they returned home. Mr. Johnson told the police officer that neither he nor his wife had entered their camp. He explained that his wife had gotten out of the truck to urinate but that he had stayed in the truck.

8.            Mr. Johnson continued his statement by saying that on his way home in the evening, suddenly and without giving him the opportunity to apply his brakes, he saw a deer in the middle of the road he was driving on. He explained that the next day, his wife had learned through the digital platform Facebook that police were looking for a GMC vehicle, like his, in connection with the incident. He said to himself that it could not possibly have been a man, and he and his wife had immediately called the police.



9.            Later, when the police officer asked him where they had stopped during their drive, Mr. Johnson stated that he and his wife had decided to go for a drive between noon and 1:00 p.m., that they had left the house and that they might have gone to Saint-Louis. Mr. Johnson stated that he thought he had bought groceries at the cooperative and that they had then returned home. He stated that he and his wife had returned home at approximately 2:00 p.m., picked up a few things and their dog and left for their camp. Later, he stated that they had left the house around 3:00 p.m. He told the police officer that when they left the camp in the evening, it was perhaps 7:45 or 9:00 p.m. and that the trip from their camp to their residence took approximately half an hour.



10.         Mr. Johnson told the police officer that on their way home, he and his wife were chatting and suddenly, something about four feet tall appeared in the middle of the lane and he yelled [TRANSLATION] "deer!" and did not have time to apply the brakes. He told the officer that it had been "a blur" and that they had not stopped because they thought it was a deer and he would never have thought it was a person.



11.         According to him, this episode occurred in Saint-Charles, but he was not sure on which side of Saint-Charles it occurred. However, he said that it had happened not far from the store, where the oaks are located, about a three- (3) to four- (4) minute drive from his home. He added that they had made a mistake and should have stopped, but they did not think it was a person. He stated that they had arrived home at approximately 9:30 p.m., that he had examined his 2003 GMC truck and seen a few bumps and that they had gone inside and to bed.



12.         He later told the officer again that the next day, when his wife found out through Facebook that the police were looking for a GMC truck, he had found it hard to believe. He told the officer that he could not see that this incident had occurred in Saint-Charles and wondered about the coincidence that they had seen a deer. He said that he had been in a state of shock and had said that it could not have been a man because what he had seen was a deer. He stated that he and his wife had immediately gone to the RCMP detachment in Richibucto, but that no one had been there so they had driven back home, hoping to see police officers. When they did not see a police car, they decided to call 911 and asked for a police officer to come to their home.



13.         That is how, at 1:00 p.m. on February 25, Constable Potvin came to take a two-page written statement from Mr. Johnson, marked during the voir dire as Exhibit VDC-6.





14.         Mr. Johnson later stated that after he struck the deer, he had stopped his truck about fifteen (15) feet away and looked around but had not seen anything. He repeated that he was sorry he had not stopped. According to him, he and his spouse did not discuss anything when they got home and went to their respective bedrooms to go to bed.



15.         Even later, Mr. Johnson stated that when they returned home at 9:30 p.m., they went to bed but added that before going to sleep, he watched Netflix for an hour or an hour and a half. And later still, he told the police officer that he had not watched Netflix, that he had gone up to his room and to bed immediately. He also said that he had not heard the sirens of the police cars going to the scene of the incident.



16.         At one point, Mr. Johnson stated that when it happened, he did not know it was a person, that it had been a deer and that it had been like an accident. Later, he asked the officer why it had been a person, that he could not see a person, that he was sorry, that he could not turn back the clock and that he should have stopped and looked. He added that it had not been a deer, so it [TRANSLATION] "had to be what it was, I think" and [TRANSLATION] "If it wasn't a deer, what was it? It could have been a dog, but I saw a deer." At one point, he said that if he had known it was a person, he would have stopped, but that in this case, it was a deer.



17.         Regarding the route they took to return home in the evening, Mr. Johnson explained to the officer that their camp was on Desherbiers Road and that on the way back, they had gone on Gray Road. After Gray Road, he had turned left and found himself on Saint-Charles Road North, continuing on De l’Église Road and then on Saint-Charles Road South, where his house is. Mr. Johnson told the police officer that the collision had occurred on Saint-Charles Road South. He acknowledged that initially he had been unsure of the location of his collision with the deer, but he stated that he knew the collision had occurred in Saint‑Charles.



18.         As the interview continued, Mr. Johnson revealed to the officer that his wife had drunk eight (8) beers but that that day and evening he had drunk only Diet Pepsi. He reported that his wife had started drinking Coors Light beer at approximately 3:30 p.m. He further stated that, as far as he was concerned, he rarely, if ever, consumed alcohol now, and that he had had only Diet Pepsi during the day and evening of February 24. He told the officer that he did not consume any hard liquor. When asked, he denied having consumed alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision with the deer.



19.         Mr. Johnson told the officer that he knew his spouse bought her beer at the ANBL store in Richibucto, that he believed she had a case of twelve (12) or twenty‑four (24) Coors Light beers and that when they returned home, she had put eight (8) beers in a bag and told him she was bringing eight (8) beers.



20.         Mr. Johnson maintained throughout his statement that he and his wife had driven around between approximately 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., that is, for six (6) hours, without stopping anywhere, except for that short period of time when he stopped to urinate before going to their camp and the short period of time at their camp when he remained in the truck and his wife went out to urinate.

21.         At one point, another police officer came into the interview room and reported the following information: [TRANSLATION] "liquor store in Saint-Louis around 3:00 p.m....case of beer and a pint of hard liquor, okay, in Saint-Louis, Saturday afternoon..." At that time, Mr. Johnson said that his wife had had a few beers and that she had wanted a pint of hard liquor to mix a few drinks she sometimes had with her friends. He reiterated that he had not consumed any alcohol on February 24 but that he had purchased the pint of hard liquor for his wife. He said that at the cooperative, he had purchased groceries, liquor and did not know if he had purchased chips or anything like that. He did not remember but believed that what he had purchased for his spouse was vodka. He admitted that they had gone to the cooperative but was unsure of what they purchased. Mr. Johnson stated that when they returned home afterwards, his wife asked him if he would like to have a few drinks in the evening but that he had told her that he would not, and that he only had Diet Pepsi.
