Analysis

 

[18]      Tied into each of these issues is the concern about credibility and ultimate reliability of the evidence available to reach appropriate conclusions. The evidence of both D.B. and K.M. requires special scrutiny. Both are witnesses who are "unsavoury", "untrustworthy", "unreliable", or "tainted": R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104; Vetrovec v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811. Accordingly, I will address the evidence from each of D.B. and K.M. as an overarching concern.

 

 

D.B. Reliability

 

[19]      D.B. presents as an unsavoury witness because of past dishonesty, motive to lie by reason of connection to the crime and profoundly amoral character. As a confessed accomplice who has been sentenced on the basis of certain agreed facts, the evidence of D.B. must be weighed very carefully. He cannot be trusted to tell the truth. Although a fact finder may accept all, some or none of the evidence of an accomplice as is the case with other witnesses, it is prudent to look for evidence which confirms the story of such a witness.

 

[20]      This caution is all the more important here because D.B. has previously lied to:

 


 

1.                                                      the investigating police officer, Det. Clark upon arrest for first degree murder;

2.                                                      his mother in the immediate aftermath of his arrest;

3.                                                      a psychiatrist engaged in connection with an application for judicial interim release.


 

 

[21]      Of these, clearly the most troublesome are the lies told to Det. Clark about never touching the Rifle; D.B. acknowledges these lies were in order “to protect myself” and distance himself as to handling the Rifle. He failed to disclose discussion about the price of $5000 for either him or K.M. to participate in the shooting.

 

[22]      Of some note, D.B. acknowledged these lies at Preliminary Inquiry to the extent of handling the Rifle while the Accused mounted the magazine with bullets and later to hide it between building walls after the shooting. In this trial he reconfirmed under oath that he had lied to each of the officer, psychiatrist and his mom and he carries that baggage in the Court’s assessment as to what of his evidence is reliable. 

 

[23]      There were discrepancies carefully drawn out of cross examination related to the amount of money earned by D.B. cutting cocaine with the Accused, whether one or two pairs of gloves were purchased at 7-Eleven the night of the shooting, the number of calls made to Crime Stoppers and who spoke; and who threw the empty duffel bag on the stairs. He had no real explanation for these differences. Defence concluded cross examination with:

 

            Q         And you’re a liar right? I have shown you to be a liar, right?

 

            A         Well, at times, yes.

 

[24]      The most blatant evidence which this Court unequivocally rejects from D.B. is his response to questions when confronted with the report of gun shot residue on the left sleeve of his jacket. Although it is clear that he was previously unaware of this test result, I reject his spontaneous rationalization that “it just came back to me” on the witness stand that, in both instances where he handled the gun barrel, he used his left hand. From observation of his deportment, the tone of his surprise, his hesitation and the fact that he is right-handed, that response is simply unbelievable.

 

[25]      Defence urges further that D.B. misled the Provincial Court Judge at his own sentencing hearing as to where and when his role was discussed with the Accused. For reasons I will describe later and which do not exonerate the witness, this important point will be dealt with separately.

 

[26]      Defence further urges the Court to reject the evidence of this witness in its entirety as unreliable because in the words of counsel it was “bought and paid for” as part of what D.B. considered to be a deal. The chronology of the Crown’s acceptance of a plea and their concurrence with a youth sentence including intensive rehabilitative custody supervision (IRCS) is certainly a consideration for this Court to assess. It does not, however, lead to total rejection of the witness’ evidence as utterly unreliable. My reasoning includes that:

 


 

1.                                                      Section 606, as must be explained to every person seeking to enter a guilty plea, prescribes that the Court must decide what sentence is appropriate, regardless of any joint submission;

2.                                                      The witness has been subpoenaed to testify and it remains for the Court to assess the truth or otherwise of that testimony;

3.                                                      Any favourable regime or terms of sentencing are simply part of the overall consideration of the reliability of evidence of an accomplice;

4.                                                      The witness himself confirms he was never told what to say, only that he tell the truth to the best of his ability.


 

 

[27]      In assessing D.B.'s evidence, I must consider the importance of his evidence in the case against the Accused. I note that the guilt of the Accused does not rest exclusively or even, in many respects, substantially on D.B.'s testimony. I also note that there is evidence from other sources, most notably the Agreed Facts, tending to show that D.B. is telling the truth in respect of material parts of his evidence in the context of the case as a whole.

 

[28]      Overall, as will be clear from the analysis of the key issue of role, this witness remains under scrutiny as a convicted felon and the Court must address the challenge of determining the facts from the evidence presented in total, including someone as unsavoury as this accomplice.

           

K.M. Reliability

 

[29]      Acutely aware of certain problems with D.B.’s evidence, I watched and listened to K.M.’s testimony with added caution. I noted he would listen to the entire question and think before making a response with eye contact. For example, his description of how the deceased behaved in evicting the Accused from his apartment was measured and observant. Similarly, I was impressed by the way he recapped the call to Crime Stoppers and what he said. His attempt to recall when the call was made by referring to summertime makes no sense but that did not detract from the content of his testimony.

 

[30]      His responses were chillingly candid at times, including his admission that he said he would kill W.A. for $100,000. Later he said that he did not believe W.A. would be killed but he had his hopes up and looked forward to it, more for getting the money than anything else.  Defence describes the witness as degenerate but that does not necessarily make him a liar.

 

[31]      The one point in time where the testimony of the witness changed markedly, as I specifically recorded, came when he seemed to obsess that D.B. kept forcing that they kill W.A. (Transcript October 23, 2009, pp. 19, 20, 21). Without any awareness on the part of the Court that this was new evidence that was not given earlier, I noted that the tone changed, his voice was strained and it sounded contrived to add blame to D.B. At no time did I detect similar effort to attribute blame to the Accused.

 

[32]      The fact that K.M. changed his statement just before testifying at the Preliminary Inquiry is unassailable. His explanation is that he was concerned he could be in trouble if he did not tell the truth. A full KGB statement was taken which was more favourable to the Accused than the prior statement. I must also factor in that K.M. was found guilty of drug trafficking (in an entirely separate context) in early November 2007 and completed 75 hours of community service. Defence also referred to an earlier shoplifting offence that was admitted.

 

[33]      I carry each of these considerations into the assessment of whether I may rely on the testimony of this witness but none of these points would invite rejection of relevant evidence, particularly as to his knowledge of any planning and deliberation. As with D.B.'s evidence, the guilt of the Accused does not rest exclusively or even substantially on K.M.’s testimony. Further, there is evidence from other sources tending to show that he was telling the truth in respect of material parts of his evidence in the context of the case as a whole.

 

First issue - Role of Accused

 

[34]      The Agreed Facts put the Accused at or near the door of W.A.’s residence at the time he was killed. The Crown relies on the evidence of D.B. that he knocked on W.A.’s door and the Accused was the shooter. 

 

[35]      However, while I find that the Accused was near the victim’s door at the time of the killing, I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused, rather than D.B., was the shooter. The doubt is supported by the statement of Ms. Simms to police that she adopts with some reticence that the gun seemed to change hands from “the shorter guy in white” to “the darker guy” as they barreled down the stairs. The video places the gun bag in the possession of the Accused but that is some 3 hours prior to the shooting.

 

[36]      The testimony of D.B. on this specific point is unreliable and self-serving. I agree with Crown that not much can be made of the gunshot residue on the sleeve of D.B., but the test result is consistent with the doubt raised by the only independent witness. The only other possible evidence to consider is K.M.’s testimony and that does not assist the Crown either, since none of the discussions related by K.M. identify the Accused as the planned shooter.

 

[37]      By contrast, I have no reasonable doubt that the Accused was a full and willing participant in the entire transaction leading up to and following the shooting, regardless of who pulled the trigger. 

 

[38]      The Agreed Facts place the Accused at the scene but mere proof of presence at the scene of an offence is of course not sufficient to establish party liability. Ms. Simms confirms that both parties exited the back stairs of the building together, right after she heard the shots and was looking in that direction.

 

[39]      What proof is there of a role that would at minimum confirm the Accused as aiding and/or abetting? The first and most obvious is participation by the Accused in selection of the semi-automatic assault Rifle. Without access to a firearm, no shooting would be possible. The Accused knew that there were weapons in the storage locker. The Accused obtained the keys and access code after getting the key to the apartment from W.A. on a text mail offer to chop cocaine. The video supports the evidence of D.B. that the Accused gained access and carried the Rifle from the security storage. Transportation to and from the Storage shed was arranged or attempted by use of the cell phone of the Accused.

 

[40]      The Agreed Facts further shows that the Accused called W.A. 8 minutes before the shooting and that either D.B. or the Accused knocked on the door. At best if he was not the shooter then I find that the Accused must have knocked on the door. That is more than passive presence because I am able to infer that action brought W.A. to the door at 3:35 in the morning. The Accused called W.A. at 2:27 a.m. Having then declined the two calls from W.A. to his cell-phone, the presence of the Accused at his uncle’s door would be consistent with W.A. then opening the door to talk with him.

 

[41]      Collectively this degree of involvement right up to the shooting more than amply aided the homicide to occur. As to intention to participate in the shooting, this is consistent with the discussions as recounted by both D.B. and K.M. and an inescapable inference from the actual steps taken. Those steps would also include removal of the money and drugs from the apartment which I find occurred before W.A. was shot.

 

[42]      Defence’s theory as mentioned above is that the Accused secured a firearm from his uncle’s storage shed, that gun ended up in the hands of D.B. as the shooter and the Accused was simply in the general area where the shooting occurred. The Accused's jeopardy after stealing drugs and money from his uncle, his role in thereafter obtaining the assault Rifle, the length of time that the Accused and D.B. waited for W.A. and their flight together down the back stairs following the shooting all point to a much different conclusion.

 

[43]      I turn more fully to intention in addressing the character of the homicide.

 

[44]      In summary, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused aided the commission of this shooting.

 

 

Second issue - Intent for Murder

 

[45]      The second issue draws upon the proximate context of the relationship between the Accused and W.A. For this I rely on the  steps as described in the Agreed Facts (paras. 6 to 20). Those facts are consistent with the evidence of both unsavoury witnesses (D.B. and K.M.) that the motive to remove the uncle was to access the large amount of money in storage and take over his illegal drug operation. In particular this Court notes that:

 


 

1.         the Accused was confronted by his uncle angry about the loss of 2 oz of cocaine; he had money taken from him and was evicted from his downtown residence one week before the shooting;

 

2.         the youths placed a call (I reject D.B.’s evidence of a second call) to Crime Stoppers for the specific, if ill-conceived purpose of having W.A. arrested so they could take over his drug trade. The perceived failure of that attempt two days prior to the shooting informs the issue of intention to remove W.A. from the drug trade and his money;

 

3.         D.B. and the Accused attended at South Side Storage and removed a high-powered semi-automatic Rifle on which they mounted a loaded magazine;

4.                  the Accused called the victim and then declined to answer two follow-up phone calls just prior to the shooting;

 

5.                  both D.B. and the Accused approached W.A.'s Residence, i.e. suite 206, together and one of them knocked on the door; when W.A. responded to the knock at his door, 7 shots were fired from the Rifle at close range, 3 of which hit his body.

 


 

[46]      Defence urges some doubt that the purpose or intent may have been robbery. No air of reality attaches to that theory. The Agreed Facts confirm the intent to return later for the cash in locker A0039. As to the bag of cash and drugs from the apartment, that had already been removed (Agreed Facts, paras. 18 and 25). D.B. confirmed that in his evidence and it is consistent with the evidence of Ms. Simms that these two kids barreled down the stairs, into the alley and then crouched in a recessed area which is where D.B. said the bag of money and drugs had been placed.

 

[47]      The actions of the Accused and D.B. leading up to and surrounding the shooting are consistent only with an intent on the part of both to cause W.A.’s death. Further, while Defence concedes this point, my own assessment confirms nothing would support abandonment in these circumstances.

 

Third Issue - Planning and Deliberation

 

[48]      Although the next step of discussing how to take over the uncle's business comes from two witnesses whose evidence must be carefully weighed, I am able to reliably conclude that the three youths did discuss options to eliminate W.A. from the drug trade. The obvious frailties do not detract from the existence of prior discussions which do inform and provide context to my assessment of planning and deliberation to the ultimate murder.

 

[49]      K.M. testified that he and the Accused discussed plans early on about buying drug phones off W.A. or other dealers to make their own money. K.M. said they talked about their ideas at least 3 or 4 times and would add on more ideas. At one point the Accused asked his uncle, W.A. about the idea and was told “...it was too heat because he could just attract a lot more attention and [get] yourself caught.”  By “heat” K.M. clarified that he meant attention from the police. I accept this evidence as reliable and standing alone, it would be rather benign.

 

[50]      However, both D.B. and K.M. recall specific discussions of eliminating W.A. I reject D.B.’s version of the context first arising as he came out of a washroom and overheard the other two talking about killing somebody. Apart from the deportment of his evidence, I was particularly struck by the instances in which D.B. would downplay his own initiative. This is a classic example of where I have been careful to sift the existence of content without adopting D.B.’s version of his role.

 

[51]      I accept K.M.’s recollection that none of the conversations about getting rid of W.A. started until the Accused got kicked out of his own place by the uncle. From the Agreed Facts this occurred November 23, 2007 and while it is agreed that several friends were at the suite, I find that only K.M. - who was known and approved by W.A.- was present during this confrontation. Given my acceptance of K.M.’s evidence of what occurred at this time, I further accept his evidence that the Accused was mad that his uncle took away all his money, and that he told K.M. “he had nothing to do now and nowhere to go...things would be better if my uncle wasn’t here.”

 

[52]      The idea of a call to Crime Stoppers as related by both K.M. and D.B. is confirmed as having been made November 28, 2007 according to the Agreed Facts. I interpret that as an ill-conceived attempt to eliminate W.A. from the drug trade, in K.M.’s words “so we can all get the money and the drugs and just everything else.”

 

[53]      Having previously expressed concern that K.M. then purports to fix on D.B. as forcing the fact that they should kill W.A., I nonetheless find that the three of them discussed that option at length. During those discussions, the Accused tells them about the guns in his uncle’s storage units as well as the money out there. No other source was alleged or suggested from which both of these witnesses would have been aware of this weapon source, and it was integral to the planning and deliberations.

 

[54]      Steps taken by the Accused in furtherance of his role in a deliberate plan include:

 

-           the Accused either initiates or responds to W.A.’s invitation to cut drugs on November 30 and goes inside at the restaurant alone to get the key to W.A.’s apartment;

 

-           he and D.B. remove the storage keys and PIN which enables them to obtain the Rifle and bring it back to the scene;

 

and as previously reviewed in regard to intention, but which support also the planning and deliberation:

 

-           the Accused calls the victim and then declines to answer two follow-up phone calls;

 

-           both D.B. and the Accused approach W.A.'s Residence, i.e. suite 206, together and one of them knocks on the door;

 

-           when W.A. responds to the knock at his door, 7 shots are fired from the Rifle at close range, 3 of which hit his body.

 

[55]      All of this is set out in the Agreed Facts so it is not even necessary to rely on the evidence of D.B. that generally conforms with these points.

 

[56]      The additional points from D.B.’s evidence about purchase of gloves, earlier attempts by the Accused to shoot W.A. before he entered the apartment and where the discussion about roles occurred are not reliable in the absence of corroboration. In this respect, I return to the concern of Defence that the discrepancy in D.B.’s evidence as to the timing and location of the discussion of role amounts to a deception of the sentencing judge. First, I note that the passage quoted from the agreed facts at D.B.’s sentencing hearing is somewhat vague. It nonetheless supports an inference that the discussion occurred downstairs and that is the more likely scenario. I find the assertion by D.B. at this trial that the conversation occurred 5 meters before the door was yet a further attempt to somewhat reduce the serious culpability of his own role. I reject his evidence at trial on this point. As a corollary of limited consequence, it means that the Provincial Court was not misled as to where the discussion occurred. I make no further comment on the consequences that may derive for him from his testimony at this trial.

 

[57]      The goggles left by a dumpster and a second pair in the bag retrieved from D.B.’s house could support a level of planning and deliberation; but in the absence of corroboration from Ms. Simms I am not sure whether they were worn by either or both youths and it adds nothing to the level of planning already summarized.

 

[58]      The Accused then is the fundamental link to obtaining the key to get into the uncle's residence where he and D.B. remove money, drugs and the keys/pin to access the security lockers. The Accused proceeds to access the weapon in the company of D.B. and returns to the same residence with the weapon transported in a duffel bag.

 

[59]      A planned murder is a murder that was committed as a result of a plan or scheme that was formulated before the murder was committed. The scheme or plan may be quite simple. The scheme or plan can be formulated long before the murder or very shortly before the murder.  It does not have to be a good plan. K.M. described some of their ideas about shooting as “childish”.

 

[60]      In this case, I can come to no other conclusion but that the Accused and D.B. planned to kill W.A.

 

[61]      A deliberate murder is one that is carefully thought out, not hasty, rash, or impulsive. A person commits deliberate murder when he or she thinks about the consequences before committing the murder, such as the advantages and disadvantages of committing the murder. The time for careful thought need not be long, but a murder committed on the spur of the moment, suddenly or impulsively under the influence of some emotion or passion would not qualify. I find that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that this murder was deliberate.

 

[62]      It follows that if the Accused was not the one who shot W.A., then he aided, knowing that the killing had been planned and deliberated upon by D.B. He knew of D.B.’s intention to kill, and he intended W.A.’s death. Any suggestion that the Accused intended something short of W.A.’s death is simply not supported on the evidence, and would be illogical in the circumstances. Therefore I find the Accused guilty as a party to first degree murder on Count 1.

 

Weapons offences

 

[63]      Being unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was the shooter, the essential elements for Count 2 cannot be established. Similarly on Count 4 there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the Accused pointed the firearm.

 

[64]      By contrast on Count 3 and as conceded by the Defence, it is clear on the video that the Accused was carrying the Rifle in the bag left on the stairs with the gun case inside. He was also observed by Ms. Simms carrying the weapon in the alley although that evidence alone would not support Count 3. I find the Accused guilty on Count 3.

 

[65]      For the same reason Count 5 is proven, but I invite submissions as to whether a stay of either Count 3 or Count 5 is warranted on the basis of R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.

 

[66]      The Crown confirmed the withdrawal of Counts 6, 7 and 8 in its closing argument.

 

[67]      As for Count 9, I have no hesitation in concluding on the basis of the evidence that the Accused stole the weapon from his uncle without any possible colour of right and was in possession of the stolen firearm. Therefore, I find the Accused guilty as charged on Count 9.

 

[68]      As for Count 10, it is clear that under s. 108 the evidence of the possession of a firearm, the serial number of which has been obliterated, is in the absence of evidence to the contrary proof that the person possesses it knowing of the obliteration. There was no evidence adduced to the contrary in this case.
