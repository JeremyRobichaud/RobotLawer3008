B.      FACTS RELATING TO THE OFFENCE
[7]               This was a lengthy trial. Evidence was heard throughout a six week period. Much of the evidence was detailed and complex. The evidence is summarized at various points in the Charge to the Jury, which is a written public document that was filed as a lettered exhibit and sent to the jury room, once the jury began their deliberations. In particular, the evidence is summarized at pp. 138-307 of the Charge to the Jury. I adopt that summary and will not repeat it.

[8]               Fact finding in jury trials, at the sentencing stage, involves two distinct processes. They are set out in s. 724(2) of the Criminal Code and they are as follows: first, all facts that are “essential to the jury’s verdict” must be taken as proven and facts “consistent only with a verdict rejected by the jury” must be rejected; second, any additional facts that are relevant and necessary to sentencing may be found by the trial judge on the basis of evidence heard at trial and any additional evidence heard at sentencing. Aggravating facts must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and mitigating facts must be proved on a balance of probabilities. However, the Crown’s failure to prove an aggravating fact does not infer the existence of an opposing mitigating fact. It may be that neither the aggravating or mitigating version of facts can be proven in relation to some issue and that the trier is “simply left not knowing one way or the other”. See: R. v. Ferguson (2008), 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), 228 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at paras. 15-22 (S.C.C.); R. v. Gauthier (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 231 at paras. 20-24 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Smickle (2013), 2013 ONCA 678 (CanLII), 304 C.C.C. (3d) 371 at paras. 17-25 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Holt (1983), 1983 CanLII 3521 (ON CA), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 32 at 51-2 (Ont. C.A).

[9]               The jury’s verdicts, finding both accused guilty of first degree murder, necessarily mean that the following five elements or facts have been proved beyond reasonable doubt:

•        first, that Laura Babcock is deceased. This was a vigourously contested issue at trial and it has now been resolved against the accused;

•        second, that Laura Babcock died as a result of an unlawful act. This too was a disputed issue as the defence took the position that she could have died by accidental drug overdose or by some misadventure, due to an allegedly high risk lifestyle. This issue was necessarily resolved  in favour of the Crown;

•        third, that both accused “participated” in the unlawful act that caused Ms. Babcock’s death, either as a principal or party;

•        fourth, that both accused had one of the requisite states of mind for murder, namely, an intent to kill Ms. Babcock or an intent to cause her bodily harm of a kind that was likely to result in her death and where the accused decided to proceed in spite of that known risk; and

•        fifth, that Millard “planned and deliberated” on murdering Ms. Babcock and that Smich knowingly and intentionally assisted or encouraged Millard in carrying out that “planned and deliberate” murder.

[10]           The particular factual or evidentiary basis on which the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the above five essential elements or facts had been proved, is not something that can be inferred from their verdicts. Indeed, different jurors may have taken different factual routes in order to arrive at their verdicts. It was a circumstantial case, there was no crime scene, the body or remains of the deceased were never recovered, and the evidentiary record was large and complex. As a result, the exact act that caused death and the exact role played by each accused was unknown. In this regard, the instructions in the Charge to the Jury were as follows (at pp. 103 and 112-113):

There is no direct evidence as to exactly what caused Ms. Babcock’s death or how it was caused, as her body or her remains have never been found. There is also no direct evidence as to the exact role played or the exact act committed by the person or persons who caused her death.

…

If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or the other of the two accused must have intentionally applied some kind of objectively dangerous force to Ms. Babcock, without her consent, and thereby caused her death, and that the other accused was present knowingly and intentionally assisting or encouraging the first accused, then they would both be parties to the “unlawful act.” The first accused is referred to as the principal and the second accused is referred to as an aider or abettor. Aiding means helping or assisting. Abetting means encouraging. You need not determine which accused was the primary or principal actor who actually committed the immediate act or acts that caused death, nor need you determine which accused was the secondary party who aided or abetted. They are both treated in law as parties to the “unlawful act” and parties to the offence of manslaughter, provided that one or the other of the two accused carried out the immediate act that caused death and provided that the other accused knowingly and intentionally assisted or encouraged the first accused in carrying out that act.

Furthermore, you need not determine the exact nature of the act committed by each accused, that is, the exact act committed by the principal that caused Ms. Babcock’s death and the exact act committed by the secondary party who aided or abetted the principal.  However, you must be satisfied that both accused were present and that both knowingly and intentionally participated in the act that caused death, either as a principal or as an aider or abettor, before you can find that they were both parties to manslaughter. [Emphasis in the original].

[11]           Given that the precise factual findings made by the jury, beyond the five essential elements, cannot be gleaned from the jury’s verdict, it is the trial judge who has to make any such findings of fact pursuant to s. 724(2)(b). I am satisfied of the following facts beyond reasonable doubt:

•        Millard formed a motive to kill Ms. Babcock, expressed in graphic terms in the April 2012 text messages with his girlfriend, Christina Noudga. This motive arose because Ms. Babcock was causing difficulties in Millard’s relationship with Ms. Noudga. However, there was a further and more complex motive that was operating at the same time, namely, Millard and Smich had entered into a broad conspiracy that involved guns, various crimes, and killing. I excluded some of the evidence relating to this broad conspiracy, not because it lacked relevance but because it was highly prejudicial. Some of this evidence was admitted at trial after editing, some is found in the Motion Records, and some was filed in the sentencing materials. See, e.g., R. v. Millard and Smich, 2017 ONSC 5928, where some of this evidence is discussed in the context of a pre-trial Motion. The two motives became tied up together when the two accused engaged in the building, testing, purchase, and preparation of an incinerator that was used to dispose of bodies. Both of these two motives coincided in the spring and early summer of 2012 and they became the reasons why Millard and Smich killed Ms. Babcock;

•        Millard and Smich were both involved in the early planning stages of the Babcock homicide, as evidenced by their text messages relating to testing and preparation of an incinerator, beginning on May 25, 2012;

•        Millard purchased The Eliminator in June 2012, when a home-made incinerator did not work, and Smich continued to be involved with Millard in the preparation and testing of this new commercial incinerator;

•        Millard arranged to purchase a .32 calibre handgun from Matthew Ward-Jackson between June 30 and July 3, 2012, at the same time as he was in repeated telephone contact with Ms. Babcock. She was needy and vulnerable at this time and she was infatuated with Millard. She must have readily agreed to meet with him when they had their final telephone contact on July 3, 2012 at 6:16 pm. By this time, Millard was already in possession of the .32 calibre handgun and he was expecting to receive bullets for it by “tonight”;

•        Millard met up with Ms. Babcock near the Kipling subway station on the evening of July 3, 2012. He must have arranged to pick her up, in their final telephone call at 6:16 pm, and he drove her to his home in Etobicoke. Smich was already present at the Etobicoke home and Millard texted him, “don’t be outfront”. All of the detailed circumstantial evidence compellingly proves that Ms. Babcock was killed sometime that night at the Etobicoke home, while both Millard and Smich were present. I cannot make findings, “one way or the other” as Doherty J.A. put it in R. v. Smickle, supra at paras. 17-25, as to the exact roles played and the exact acts committed by Millard and Smich. However, I am satisfied that the jury found as a fact that they both “participated” in the homicide, as that requirement was explained in the Charge to the Jury;

•        Millard and Smich incinerated Ms. Babcock’s remains in The Eliminator on the night of July 23/24, 2012. Smich posed happily and proudly for a photograph in front of The Eliminator and Millard then took a further photograph of Ms. Babcock’s remains burning in The Eliminator. Smich immediately began composing the “ashy stone” rap song on Ms. Babcock’s iPad that same night. He later performed it for Millard and for Smich’s girlfriend, Ms. Meneses, at Millard’s Etobicoke home. He also performed it in the garage of his family’s Oakville home for two friends, Mr. Cronin and Mr. Liberatore. The song referred to the burning or killing of a “bitch”, within a broader context of Smich boasting to the two young boys about his criminal endeavours or exploits, which included the murder of Ms. Babcock.

[12]           The Crown filed a number of Victim Impact Statements. They are poignant and heart-breaking. I cannot begin to do them justice. Ms. Babcock’s parents and her brother state the following:

Few parents will ever have to see trophy pictures of their beloved daughter’s remains being cremated. These images will haunt us for the rest of our lives.

Before you [the two accused] put your diabolical scheme into action we were a happy family. Now we wake up each morning with the same sadness and disbelief that this could have ever happened. Now we are on medication for depression, tremors and nightmares. For years now, the sleeplessness and headaches have been crippling. Finding joy in our lives requires planning and effort and holding on to happiness for anything but short periods is impossible.

We long to see Laura’s smile and hear her voice. For years we have jumped every time the phone rang, there was a knock on the door, or a car went slowly down the street. We tried so hard to be hopeful because the alternative was unthinkable. Now we know that she was taken from us before we realized that she was gone. All those years of wondering, searching, praying and hoping has taken a huge toll on us.

…

So far we have agonized over our loss for 2,050 days. Our grief is so deep. We will always love and forever miss our cherished daughter. Our lives are overwhelmed with sadness.

C.      FACTS RELATING TO THE TWO OFFENDERS
[13]           Millard did not testify at either of the two murder trials. However, his antecedents are set out in a number of letters filed on sentencing, in particular, a lengthy detailed letter from his mother. He was born on August 30, 1985 in Toronto and so he is now 32 years old. He was 26 years old on July 3/4, 2012, at the time of the Babcock homicide, and he was 27 years old on May 6, 2013, at the time of the Bosma homicide.

[14]           Millard enjoyed a secure and close relationship with both his father and his mother. He had an advantaged upbringing and had obvious talents and ability in a number of fields. His parents divorced in 1996, when Millard was 11. He graduated from high school with honours and proceeded to complete a wide variety of diploma courses at three separate community colleges (Sheridan, Humber, and George Brown). He held a number of jobs. At the time of the two homicides, he was working at his father’s company, Millard Air, which operated a large hangar that serviced aircraft at the Waterloo Airport. Although he was only 26 and 27 years old at the relevant times in 2012 and 2013, Millard had already accumulated significant personal wealth and he owned assets worth a few million dollars.

[15]           The letters filed on Millard’s behalf on sentencing, from his mother, from two women he befriended, from people he worked with, from a number of inmates, and from two prison officials all describe a positive side to his character and personality. According to these sources, he is capable of behaving respectfully and intelligently and he is capable of kindness, humour, and generosity. I observed some of these qualities during the many months that I saw Millard, while trying to work with him as a partially self-represented accused during lengthy pre-trial and trial proceedings. He is clever and he knows how and when to deploy a more socially acceptable side of his personality. His text messages and his criminal conduct, however, reveal a profoundly amoral character.

[16]           Millard was arrested in relation to the Bosma homicide on May 10, 2013. As a result, the 25 year period of parole ineligibility imposed for that murder will expire on May 10, 2038, when Millard will be 52 years old. A consecutive term of 25 years parole ineligibility for the Babcock homicide would expire on May 10, 2063, when Millard will be 77 years old. Millard’s only criminal record is his conviction for the first degree murder of Tim Bosma. This offence, of course, took place some ten months after the first degree murder of Laura Babcock for which he must now be sentenced.

[17]           Smich was born on August 13, 1987. He is almost exactly two years younger than Millard. He is 30 years old at the present time, he was 24 years old at the time of the Babcock homicide, and he was 25 years old at the time of the Bosma homicide. Smich testified at the Hamilton murder trial but not at the Toronto murder trial. A large number of letters have been filed on the sentencing hearing that describe his personality and his antecedents.

[18]           Smich’s parents were immigrants from Poland. Smich was the youngest of three siblings. Both parents worked hard and provided for their children. However, Mr. Dungey advises that Smich’s father was an abusive alcoholic. The parents separated in 1990, when Smich was three years old. The father paid child support and the mother raised the three children, while also working at her own job. Smich is close to his mother but he is estranged from his father. Smich dropped out of high school after completing grade 10. His mother and his two sisters attribute his lack of success in school to “reading comprehension and ADHD” learning disorders that were “unrecognized and untreated”. After dropping out of school, Smich developed a drug problem, regularly consuming marijuana and dabbling in cocaine. He never trained for a trade and he has little or no employment history.

[19]           At the time of the Babcock homicide in 2012, Smich was living between his mother’s home in Oakville and Millard’s home in Etobicoke. Both were large, comfortable, attractive residences in upper middle class neighbourhoods. Smich did odd jobs for Millard, painting and cleaning at the various properties and businesses that Millard owned. Millard supported Smich financially by paying for his expenses. According to the evidence heard at trial, Smich’s main goal in life was to become a rap music artist. There is some evidence that Millard had offered to help Smich financially with these endeavours, for example, by assisting in recording Smich’s rap songs in a studio and having them released commercially. There was testimony at trial that Smich emulated or exhibited a gangster persona that was tied up with his interest in rap music. This perhaps helps to explain why and how Smich came to be committed to the broader criminal conspiracy with Millard. In any event, Smich acquired a criminal record as follows: in September 2003, when he would have been 16 years old, he was convicted of break, enter and theft, and he was sentenced to one year probation in Youth Court; in March 2004, when he would still have been 16 years old, he was convicted of theft under and two counts of fail to comply, and was sentenced in Youth Court to 18 months probation; in January 2007, when he would have been 19, he was convicted of possession of a scheduled substance and fail to comply, and was sentenced to a $500 fine; in June 2014, at age 26, he was convicted of impaired driving and was sentenced to a $1000 fine; and in June 2016, at age 28, he was convicted of the first degree murder of Tim Bosma and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

[20]           The letters filed on Smich’s behalf from his family, from friends, and from the other inmates on his unit all speak highly of him, pointing out a kind and helpful side to his personality. One of these letters, from the mother of an Oakville family that moved onto the same street as the Smich family in 2003, when Smich would have been 15 or 16, states that Smich and others were “coming from a ‘thug life’ gangster rapper kind of jungle… struggling with their identities… he [Smich] found it difficult to find a job. He lacked self-confidence and he didn’t have any education. I kept directing him back to school, adult, trade or otherwise, but he didn’t feel smart enough to even attempt those ideas… Dellen [Millard] was the big brother he never had, and he was a pilot, and a multi-millionaire! Mark [Smich] was intoxicated just by the fact that this guy wanted to hang out with him”.

[21]           Smich was arrested on the Bosma murder, shortly after Millard’s arrest, on May 22, 2013. Accordingly, the 25 year period of parole ineligibility for that murder will expire on May 22, 2038, when Smich will be 50 years old. A further 25 year consecutive period of parole ineligibility would expire on May 22, 2063, when Smich will be 75 years old. Smich appears to have used his time in custody productively during the past four years. In August 2015, he wrote the eight hour long GED high school equivalency exam, he passed every section, and he earned his certificate. He is now taking college courses in business administration. He also obtained a job at Millhaven as the “unit cleaner” and was taking various programs at that institution. He has two misconducts at the Toronto East Detention Centre.
