At least a sense of what Nova Scotia Courts have considered
appropriate sentences may be obtained from a review of cases
such as the following:
R. v. Crane (1972), 5 N.S.R. (2d) 37 (N.S.C.A.) — sentence of
four years for rape affirmed — no details given of offence,
except three men involved, threats of violence and acts of
indecency.
R. v. Muise (No. 3) (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 440, 11 N.S.R. (2d) 216
(N.S.C.A.) — sentence of three years increased to four years
— rape of 16-year-old hitchhiker, struck with bottle and gross
indecencies.
R. v. Phillips (1975), 13 N.S.R. (2d) 121 (N.S.C.A.) — sentence of
seven years reduced to five years — rape of college girl, with
repeated threats of death — bad previous criminal record.
Amero v. The Queen (1978), 3 C. R. (3d) S-45, 23 N.S.R. (2d) 646
(N.S.C.A.) — sentence of six years reduced to four years —
17-year-old raped woman near residence — threats with
broken bottle — previous record of minor crimes — dicta pp.
S-49-50 C. R. , p. 650 N.S.R.: "A six year sentence for rape is
normally only imposed if there are grave aggravating circum
stances."
R. v. Chaisson (1979), 31 N.S.R. (2d) 115 (N.S.C.A.) — 21-year-
old climbed to apartment of woman and two babies — drank
scotch and after two hours forced the girl at knife point and
raped her — previous convictions for theft and assault — a
planned attack — sentence of two years increased to four
if . .. would appear normally to deserve at least five or six
years' imprisonment" (p. 118) but only four years given
because accused had spent seven months in jail before
sentence and because of the trial Judge's strong feeling that
personal deterrence was not required. While awaiting
sentence accused had received extensive treatment by psychi
atrists who reported "great progress".
R. v. Miller (1979), 32 N.S.R. (2d) 87 — 19-year-old broke into
house of a 65-year-old woman, robbed her, unclothed her and
attempted rape, struck her causing injury, threats of death,
forced her to go with him in her car which he wrecked causing
further injury — woman in hospital six weeks — previous
convictions for manslaughter, assault causing bodily harm and
break, enter and theft — sentences totalling eight years
affirmed on appeal.
Downey v. The Queen (June 18, 1980 — unreported — S.C.C.
00137 — N.S.C.A.) — 28-year-old with lengthy criminal
record including prior conviction for rape and assaults causing
bodily harm — entered apartment, threatened baby and
