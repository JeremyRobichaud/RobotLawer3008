[1]               Brian Ralph Beglau has pled guilty to the second degree murder of his estranged wife, Melanie Hunter, on September 22, 2015, contrary to ss 231(1) & (7) and 745(c) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46.

[2]               The principle issue that remained was to identify an appropriate period of parole ineligibility. On February 15, 2017 I gave oral reasons on that issue. This judgment reduces those oral reasons to a reported form.

II.        Overview
[3]               The elements of the offence of second degree murder to which Mr. Beglau pled are that he caused the death of Melanie Hunter, he caused her death unlawfully, and he had the state of mind required for murder.

[4]               To support his guilty plea, Mr. Beglau has admitted (Exhibit S-1) that on September 22, 2015 he murdered his estranged wife of 29 years, Melanie Hunter, in her residence in Sherwood Park. Mr. Beglau and Ms. Hunter were separated in 2012 and had maintained separate residences since that time, although sometimes experiencing an “on again, off again” relationship during that separation.

[5]               For approximately one month prior to the murder, Ms. Hunter had been distancing herself from Mr. Beglau and had begun another relationship. Mr. Beglau attempted to discourage that relationship, sent text messages, and made a telephone call to Ms. Hunter’s new friend.

[6]               This resulted in a telephone call from Ms. Hunter to the RCMP on September 9, 2015 complaining of uninvited visits, harassment, and the contacting of her friends and family. No charges were laid as a result of that report to the RCMP, but Mr. Beglau was warned to limit his communication to Ms. Hunter to emails only, and not to enter her house without permission.

[7]               On September 22, 2015, Mr. Beglau and Ms. Hunter were to have a meeting at a lawyer’s office to sign divorce papers, but Mr. Beglau claimed to have health issues and the appointment was cancelled. Later that day, Mr. Beglau drove to Sherwood Park, parked his vehicle a considerable distance away from Ms. Hunter’s residence, entered the residence through the front door shortly after 10:00 p.m., unannounced and without permission, and proceeded up the stairs to the second level bedroom, wearing gloves and with a serrated steak knife in hand.

[8]               Ms. Hunter was in bed on Facetime with her new friend.

[9]               Ms. Hunter looked up from the video screen, showed anger and asked Mr. Beglau what he was doing in her premises. The Facetime video became black but the audio remained on. Ms. Hunter began to say something and then suddenly began to scream. The home alarm system began sounding and Ms. Hunter’s screams lasted for approximately two minutes, followed by silence.

[10]           Ms. Hunter’s friend tried to communicate with her, then called 911 on another line. He could hear Ms. Hunter’s dogs barking, the television, and subsequently the RCMP arriving at the premises.

[11]           Mr. Beglau agrees that he attacked Ms. Hunter with a serrated steak knife and stabbed or slashed her on the neck, face, left and right arms, torso, hands and wrists. The wound to Ms. Hunter’s neck spanned from ear to ear, cutting the right carotid artery, the right jugular vein, injuring the left jugular vein and inducing injuries to her cervical spine. There were five wounds on her face, and her left arm was slashed from her shoulder down the upper arm to the inside of the elbow. There were two major and two minor stab wounds on the right arm, an abrasion to the upper right chest, two further superficial wounds in that area, and a total of seven defensive stab wounds to her hands. In total there were 21 major or minor stab or slashing wounds suffered by Ms. Hunter which caused her death, which causation of death was intended by Mr. Beglau.

[12]           When the RCMP arrived at the residence, the front and rear sliding doors were locked, and the RCMP had to access and unlock a second story window. The master bedroom door was locked and the door to the ensuite bathroom was locked from the inside.

[13]           Ms. Hunter was seen lying on the floor with her upper body under the bed. Mr. Beglau was found in the bathroom suffering from self-inflicted wounds to his throat and wrists, having used an exacto knife on himself. Mr. Beglau was taken to the hospital where he received 10 stitches to each of his wrists and 29 stitches to his neck. He indicated that he remembered taking sleeping pills, and a toxicology report from the hospital showed Zopiclone and Carboxy-THC present in his blood.

[14]           Upon a review of Ms. Hunter’s house, the RCMP were unable to find any knives in her residence that resembled the serrated steak knife used in the murder, but they did find three steak knives in Mr. Beglau’s residence of the same appearance, brand, size and style as the knife used by Mr. Beglau to commit the murder.
