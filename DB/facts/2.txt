II.                 Context



[5]                                       The appellant, a Moncton native, returned to the area in 2007. Following a leg fracture, she was prescribed pain killers, including hydromorphone. Tragically, she became addicted to the latter, and thus began her foray into criminality.



[6]                                       Unable to pay for the needed drugs, the appellant stole from her employer, appropriating to her own use $10,100 in rent payments and damage deposits she collected and held in trust by virtue of her employment as building superintendent. She also sought to sate her voracious appetite for drugs by defrauding her mother and adoptive father, feeding them false stories of impending grievous bodily harm unless the financial demands of dangerous extortionists were satisfied. Initially, the appellant kept a record of the funds provided by her parents in the hope – probably one of many instances of drug-induced self-delusion – that she would, at some unspecified point, reimburse them. In time, the recordkeeping ceased, and the total amount extracted from her parents became largely conjectural, a point acknowledged by the appellant’s mother in her victim impact statement: “it is very difficult to get a picture of the extent of the [financial] damages”. Thankfully, as part of the plea negotiations, the parties settled upon $400,000 as the amount the appellant’s parents furnished in response to the appellant’s false pretences over a two-year timeframe beginning in the late summer of 2007. In truth, the money was used by the appellant for the acquisition of drugs and the maintenance of a drug-defined lifestyle.



[7]                                          On October 22, 2008, the appellant was charged with having stolen from her employer, on the previous 7th of August, more than five thousand dollars, an indictable offence under s. 334(a) of the Criminal Code. As noted, the precise amount stolen was $10,100. She was released from custody upon giving an undertaking to the presiding judge.



[8]                                       On July 30, 2009, the appellant was arrested and kept in custody until August 27, 2009. On that date, she appeared in Provincial Court to answer to three additional indictable charges. In the first, the appellant was accused of having obtained from her parents, between September 1, 2007 and July 28, 2009,  more than $5,000 by means of a false pretence (s. 362(2)(a)); in the second, it was claimed she had defrauded her parents of money over the same timeframe (while the amount involved was not specified, the count referred to s. 380(1)(b)(i), which makes it an indictable offence to defraud any person where the subject-matter of the offence does not exceed five thousand dollars); and in the third and final charge, it was averred the appellant had violated her interim release undertaking (s. 145(3)(a)). While particulars of the latter were not provided in the charging document, counsel advised the sentencing judge that the breach occurred when the appellant defrauded her parents, conduct that offended against the undertaking’s promise to “keep the peace and be of good behavior”.



[9]                                       Tellingly, at least insofar as the appellant’s state in the summer of 2009 is concerned, the presiding judge ordered an assessment of her mental condition (s. 672.11). He also remanded her into custody.



[10]                                   Two months later, more precisely on October 20, 2009, the appellant pled guilty to the charges of theft and breach of undertaking described above. She also pled guilty to the charge of fraud once it was amended to refer to s. 380(1)(a). As a result, the fraud at issue involved property of a value exceeding $5,000. In exchange, the Crown withdrew the indictable charge under s. 362(2)(a) (obtaining more than $5,000 from her parents by false pretence). The judge then adjourned sentencing to October 26.



[11]                                   On the return date, Crown counsel, Anthony Allman, Q.C., outlined the salient facts in relation to each offence. He explained that the charge of theft arose out of the appellant’s failure to remit to her employer rent payments and damage deposits she had collected in her capacity as building superintendent. He then offered the following insights into the factual substratum of the fraud charge:



With regard to the [charge of fraud], Your Honour, [D.S.] is the biological mother of [the appellant]. Her husband [T.S.] is in fact [the appellant’s adoptive] father. […]   [The appellant] had originally moved away from Moncton. She came back to Moncton in 2007. She started telling her mother various stories in order to get money out of her mother. Among these stories were that she was being harassed and receiving threats that her house would get fire bombed, that her windows were getting broken […] The scenario evolved until she was telling her parents that her life was in danger and that more money would be needed so that she could move to a safe location, otherwise she would get killed. […] So, she was deceiving her parents into believing that she was the subject of very serious threats herself and that she needed money to prevent the nasty things happening to her that she claimed were going to happen. In fact, of course, obviously, they weren’t true, they were false statements. In order to come up with the moneys that she asked for over this period of time, [T.S. and D.S.] used up their lifetime savings, they maxed out their credit cards to [get] cash advances on the credit cards and basically it’s left them financially devastated. In addition -- as you’ll see from the victim impact statements, and I don’t know which is really more upsetting, there’s the financial devastation which is bad in itself and there’s the fact that she’s betrayed them.



[12]                                   Crown counsel advised the judge it was estimated the appellant had defrauded her parents of approximately $400,000 and that there was no realistic expectation of restitution of any portion of that loss. He pointed to the following mitigating circumstances: (1) the appellant’s guilty pleas; (2) the fact that she was a first offender; (3) her cooperation with the police and prosecution; and (4) her genuine remorse and sincere apology to the victims. In his mind, the aggravating circumstances were: (1) the theft and fraud involved breaches of trust; (2) the fraud victims were the appellant’s parents; and (3) the emotional and financial devastation arising from the fraud.



[13]                                   Crown counsel then informed the judge that the parties were jointly recommending the imposition of a sentence totalling two years (net of remand time), beginning that day. In that regard, he took pains to underscore the significance of the appellant’s negotiated guilty pleas by stressing that: (1) each trial would have been “complicated”; and (2) the trial on the fraud charge would have been “very painful […] for the people involved”. Crown counsel added the prosecution saw no reason for a departure “from the practice that has been customary of giving double time” for pre-disposition custody. In his judgment, it followed that a credit of six months would likely have been given in fixing the ultimate sentence, absent any joint recommendation. He went on to point out that, in any event, he would have been “looking for three years”, an objective barely above the joint recommendation, but significantly below the sentence ultimately imposed.



[14]                                   Defence counsel filed with the judge a letter authored by the appellant in which she expressed remorse and detailed her background (family, employment, medical and addiction history). He also reviewed a fairly large number of judicial precedents to buttress the reasonableness of the agreed-upon sentence. Counsel submitted the sentence in question was “within the ball park” and that both he and Crown counsel agreed “it was reasonable”. Counsel emphasized the following: (1) the crimes were not motivated by greed, but prompted by drug addiction; (2) the appellant’s genuine remorse; (3) the losses sustained by the appellant, including first and foremost the tearing of “all ties with her parents”; (4) she was manipulated by her drug dealer; and (5) the circumstances that gave cause for hope, including her compliance with “the Methadone program since January [of 2009] and her drug-free state since that time”.



[15]                                   In their victim impact statements, the appellant’s parents describe, often in poignant terms, how their daughter’s perfidy devastated them both emotionally and financially, and how their prolonged failure to see through her false pretences was a source of deep embarrassment. Significantly, the appellant’s mother considered suicide on three distinct occasions and received psychological counseling, while the appellant’s father went without needed medication for several months and sold various belongings to generate the funds he was told were required to shield his daughter from harm. That said, there are parts of the victim impact statements that suggest the parents’ most painful loss may well be what they perceive as the “loss” of their daughter. One can only hope, perhaps chimerically, that their well of forgiveness has not dried up.



[16]                                   In rejecting the joint recommendation and sentencing the appellant to four years in the penitentiary (18 months for the theft, 30 months consecutive for the fraud and 90 days concurrent for the breach of undertaking), the judge did not identify any supporting judicial precedent. His view was simply that, given the breach of trust arising from both the theft and the fraud and bearing in mind the adverse effects of the latter as described in the victim impact statements, the agreed-upon sentence was “not enough”. In that regard, he made the following observations:



THE COURT:        […] The amount as I said is a very large amount and I know what the case law says, the range of cases – the champion case is the Ontario Court of Appeal, first of all. Gasparetto [[2008] O.J. No. 3840 (QL)] is the Ontario Court of Justice, Kahn [(2002), 181 B.C.A.C. 3, [2002] B.C.J. No. 2950 (QL), 2002 BCCA 703] is from British Columbia Court of Appeal, Harding [[2002] B.C.J. No. 2502 (QL), 2002 BCCA 606], British Columbia Court of Appeal, Hartz [(2002), 312 A.R. 399, [2002] A.J. No. 614 (QL), 2002 ABCA 108], Alberta Court of Appeal, Waddell [(2005), 2005 CanLII 4925 (MB PC), 191 Man.R. (2d) 161, [2005] M.J. No. 46 (QL)], Manitoba Provincial Court Judge Wesley Swail and the Kuriya [(2003), 261 N.B.R. (2d) 153, [2003] N.B.J. No. 336 (QL), 2003 NBCA 63] one I guess is the only one from New Brunswick, correct?



[…]



And, in that case, [Mr. Kuriya] defrauded ACOA of some eight-hundred and forty thousand dollars. Now, Mr. Justice Russell, in this case reviewed some of the jurisprudence and this person was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary and as well, there was a restitution order of eight-hundred and forty thousand dollars in favour of ACOA and that’s basically it. Now, on imposing a sentence, we have to consider of course, the aims or principles or purposes of sentencing as [enunciated] in  Section 17 to 18 (sic) of the Code. We have to consider the maximum penalty provided for by parliament for each offense. We have to consider the plea of guilty and the fact that the accused has no prior record. We have to consider the mitigating and aggravating factors and as I said, the appropriate jurisprudence. The joint recommendation has to be given serious consideration and I’ve done that and there are many reasons why joint recommendations should be accepted but if we believe that it’s contrary to the best interest of justice, then of course we’re not bound to follow them and I don’t think two years is enough in this case. Like I say, it’s a tragic situation in terms of who the money was taken from and the effect it had on them and she had to know the effect it would have on them because these are her parents, her birth mother and her [adoptive] father. And – and, I’m also going to take into consideration the fact that she did – that the drugs are a factor here. Apparently, they were a major factor in her life. […]



As I mentioned before, if we’re going to denounce conduct of this sort, specifically to this lady, and she may not be a danger again, but general deterrence and if we’re going to really tell people that when you do something like this, there’s a serious consequence that will follow. I think it has to be done with serious jail time and not just a token jail time.





[17]                                   The sentencing judge did not specify the credit, if any, given for time spent in pre-disposition custody. Using the 2:1 credit ratio accepted by Crown counsel, the total jail time actually imposed (four years in the penitentiary) equates to a term of 4.5 years. Just as noteworthy, the jail term prescribed is twice what was agreed upon in exchange for the appellant’s guilty pleas.



[18]                                   Finally, I would wrap up the contextual overview with a bit of procedural housekeeping. In her handwritten Notice of Appeal, the self-represented appellant used the expression “extortion (theft)” to refer to the underlying offence or offences. It is clear, however, that she intended to contest the global sentence imposed in the court below. On that score, suffice it to mention that the Notice of Appeal describes the sentence at issue as one of “4 years”. I would amend the Notice of Appeal mutatis mutandis.
