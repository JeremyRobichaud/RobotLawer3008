Part 1: The Evidence

 

[12]            The evidence relating to the disputed issues is of two types: testimony of eyewitnesses and testimony regarding admissions alleged to have been made by S.R.B. I will discuss the credibility and reliability of the witnesses and the evidence generally before examining evidence regarding the disputed issues.

 


[13]            All five of the eyewitnesses, K.B., Mr. Laboucan, Mr. Briscoe, M.W. and D.T., testified. Of these five, four are alleged accomplices of S.R.B. The Supreme Court of Canada in Vetrovec v. The Queen (1982), 1980 CanLII 310 (BC CA), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 537 held that there is no fixed and invariable rule regarding the testimony of accomplices. Their evidence may be untrustworthy, but this can be said of other witnesses as well. Rather than treating accomplices as a category, the trial judge should examine all factors that might impair the credibility of a particular witness and decide whether that witness’ credibility is questionable. If the testimony of a witness may be suspect, and that testimony is central to the case, then, as a matter of common sense, confirmatory evidence should be found before reliance is placed on the witness’ testimony. The confirmatory evidence does not have to be evidence that implicates the accused. It need only be evidence that, if accepted, can enable the court to conclude that the untrustworthy witness is telling the truth. The evidence can come from other untrustworthy witnesses: R. v. Winmill (1999), 1999 CanLII 1353 (ON CA), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. CA). The confirmatory evidence allows the court to rely not only on the confirmed evidence, but also on other aspects of the witnesses’ testimony.

 

[14]            Both the Crown and the defence submit that Mr. Laboucan’s evidence is suspect and should not be believed. He is an accomplice, he had been tried and was awaiting judgment when he gave his direct evidence, and had been convicted when he was cross-examined. He has appealed his conviction. He still has a lot at stake and his evidence is completely self-serving. I agree that Mr. Laboucan’s credibility is highly suspect. Further, in the search for confirmatory evidence, there is not only little to confirm Mr. Laboucan’s testimony, it is radically different from the evidence of all of the other witnesses, not only the others who were charged as a result of Miss Courtepatte’s death, but also K.B. and other witnesses who testified regarding events during the day preceding Miss Courtepatte’s death.

 

[15]            Mr. Laboucan’s evidence is internally inconsistent, as well as inconsistent with the evidence of others. Mr. Laboucan claims to have very little memory of the sexual assault upon and beating of Miss Courtepatte, but claims to be very sure of the few details he does admit to remembering. He indicates that his memory of the sexual assault and murder, and the days following the murder, was affected by the trauma of witnessing these events. He claims that his memory of the preceding day was unaffected. However, his account of that day also differs from the consistent accounts of others, even as to immaterial matters, such as where he met up with M.W. and D.T. Faced with inconsistencies, Mr. Laboucan simply clings to his own version in all cases, claiming that all others are mistaken or lying.

 

[16]            Mr. Laboucan’s version of how Miss Courtepatte and K.B. came to get into Mr. Briscoe’s car, is that Mr. Briscoe invited them to a party. This conflicts not only with K.B.’s evidence about who made the invitation, but also with all of the other witnesses’ descriptions of Mr. Briscoe’s actions, personality, and relationship to the other persons involved. Everyone except S.R.B. and Mr. Laboucan met Mr. Briscoe for the first time on April 2nd, 2005. He was described as older, quiet, not social, even creepy. It is not believable that he would invite these girls whom he had never met before to a party, or that they would come if he did. Mr. Laboucan, on the other hand, was known to and trusted by Miss Courtepatte and K.B.

 

[17]            Mr. Laboucan testified that his memory was affected from the point that S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte. Until that moment, it seems, his memory was unaffected. For example, he was certain about the mood and topics of conversation up to that point. As of the moment of the hit, he claimed to have very little memory, except that he was very sure that for the entire attack on Miss Courtepatte, K.B. grabbed onto him and had her arms around him. He said he left with K.B. and the others when K.B. told him it was time to go and dragged him away from the golf course.

 


[18]            That S.R.B. hitting Miss Courtepatte would have such an instant and traumatic effect on Mr. Laboucan’s memory is inexplicable. Mr. Laboucan said he saw S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte with a wrench on the back of the head. The hit caused Miss Courtepatte to stumble but not fall. Mr. Laboucan is a big man, and he was even bigger – 260 pounds – in April 2005. S.R.B. is a much smaller person. The hit as described was not something that one would expect to cause such trauma to anyone, never mind a man who obviously had the physical ability to take control of such a situation. Mr. Laboucan also does not come across as a timid person. He comes from the opposite of a sheltered background. He had been living on his own, sometimes on the street, for years. He had training in karate and kickboxing. He was hired to deliver messages about debts. He said that while he  did not work directly for the Hells Angels or the Triads, he may have worked for individuals with connections to these gangs.

 

[19]            That K.B. held onto Mr. Laboucan, and in effect took control of him, telling him when to go and dragging him away from the golf course, is not believable. K.B. is much smaller than Mr. Laboucan. She was also, by everyone else’s account including her own, frozen both from shock and because she was very cold. I am sure that she did not and could not have acted as Mr. Laboucan described.

 

[20]            I do not believe Mr. Laboucan’s evidence at all. Because I find him to have essentially no credibility, I am not prepared to rely even on the parts of his evidence that are to some extent confirmed by other evidence. I will therefore simply not refer to Mr. Laboucan’s evidence when I am reviewing the evidence on specific issues. It is of no value at all.

 

[21]            Mr. Briscoe testified in a very slow and hesitant manner. At the time of his testimony, his trial was concluded and he was awaiting judgment. He said he felt nervous and at risk while testifying. He did not want to say the wrong things. His life was on the line. He also said that he had a nervous condition, that he was paranoid, and that his condition had been made worse by his history of drug use. Some of these factors go more to the issue of reliability, rather than credibility, but there is certainly sufficient cause to be concerned about confirmatory evidence.

 

[22]            M.W. had already pled guilty to first degree murder when he testified in this trial. He initially lied to the police when questioned about Miss Courtepatte’s death, but said that was because he was afraid of what would happen to him, and now that he has pleaded guilty, that is changed. Defence counsel put to him that he has not yet been sentenced and is aware that he could be sentenced as an adult or a young person. He said he knew this, but added that he still would not lie. Crown counsel argued that his evidence at trial will not affect sentencing considerations, but M.W. did not say this, and it is reasonable to infer that he might be concerned about it. There are also other factors to consider. M.W. not only lied to police himself, but also asked a friend to lie for him. Further, he testified that he used crystal meth during the day on April 2nd, 2005, and that crystal meth affects his memory. He has been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Again, some of these factors relate to more to reliability than credibility, but there is certainly sufficient reason to be concerned about confirmatory evidence.

 


[23]            D.T. is an accomplice and awaiting trial, but there are not other factors apart from this that give cause for concern about her credibility. She has made admissions regarding her own involvement that are consistent with and, in fact go further than, the evidence of other witnesses. Her credibility was not challenged in cross examination, nor was issue taken with it in argument. There are, however, concerns regarding the reliability of her evidence. At the time in question, she was using a lot of drugs on a daily basis. She had hallucinations and difficulties with her memory. She has not used drugs for two years, but still finds that her past use affects her. She still has memory problems, and still sometimes sees or hears things that are not real. She also sometimes remembers things that  did not happen – she might think that what happened in a dream really happened.

 

[24]            For each of these witnesses, particularly Mr. Briscoe and M.W., I conclude that it is sensible to look for confirmatory evidence. However, unlike Mr. Laboucan, a great deal of their evidence is confirmed. It is confirmed by the consistency with regard to significant parts of their stories as between themselves. Their accounts of the day preceding Miss Courtepatte’s death, from meeting up with each other at Humpty’s and doing a “dine and dash”, to other meetings during the day in the mall and in the mall parking lot between themselves and with Mr. Laboucan and S.R.B., as well as J.S., is quite consistent, even down to details. Their accounts of the events on the golf course are also consistent in a number of respects, with each other and with the evidence of K.B. For all three of these witnesses, confirming evidence makes it clear that much of what they have said is true. This allows me to rely not only on the confirmed evidence but on other aspects of their testimony as well, at least in the absence of a more particularized cause for concern regarding a specific aspect of the evidence.

 

[25]            In addition to the alleged accomplices, another eyewitness is Miss Courtepatte’s friend, K.B. It is not alleged, and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest, that K.B. did anything illegal or wrong in the events leading up to and on the golf course, or that she bears any responsibility for Miss Courtepatte’s death. To the extent that there is a credibility issue regarding K.B., it arises from the fact that she made prior inconsistent statements to the police, and she did this knowing that they were untrue. The main reason, she says, is that she had been threatened by Mr. Laboucan after they left the golf course. It is also clear that K.B. was very frightened and shocked on April 3rd, and that there were lasting effects of this as she stayed on with S.R.B. and the others in the days afterwards, and was at first resistant to going home with her mother when her mother found her at the mall on April 7th. Her judgment was still affected when she told the police on April 7th and 8th, and even at the beginning of an interview on April 10th, that she was not with Miss Courtepatte. This does not negatively affect my assessment of her credibility today. At the same time, the fact that she was very frightened and shocked, covering her face at times and afraid to know what was happening, must be considered when assessing the reliability of her observations and her memory.

 

[26]            No credibility issues were raised with respect to the other witnesses who testified to meeting with S.R.B. and the others the day before the events at the golf course, or in the days following. J.S., Miss B. and Mr. C. all appeared to be honest witnesses, who confirmed various aspects of the evidence of the eyewitnesses.


[27]            The witnesses who testified to statements made by S.R.B. were C.S., G.S., and B.H. C.S. and G.S. are S.R.B.’s adoptive parents and in April 2005, when S.R.B. was still a minor, they were her guardians. They gave evidence that S.R.B. made a number of statements to them when she was in custody in the Edmonton Young Offenders Centre, when she spoke to her guardians during visits and by telephone. The first of the visits took place some two weeks after her arrest. The visits and statements continued for months, even years, afterwards. The precise dates that the various statements were made by S.R.B. to C.S. and G.S. are not known.

 

[28]            C.S. and G.S. adopted S.R.B. at age five. There were difficulties in the relationship, particularly as between C.S. and S.R.B., and S.R.B. was placed in the custody of Children’s Services when she was about 14 or 15. Periods of time went by when there was little contact between them. However, S.R.B. and Mr. Briscoe had visited C.S. and G.S. in the months preceding April 2005, and S.R.B. got in touch with C.S. and G.S. after her arrest, and efforts were made on both sides to stay in touch afterwards, with C.S. and G.S. visiting S.R.B. at the Edmonton Young Offenders Centre, and S.R.B. telephoning them in the evenings. Both C.S. and G.S., particularly C.S., spoke to S.R.B. on the phone on many occasions.

 

[29]            Defence counsel has argued that I should find C.S. to be an unreliable witness because of the animosity that she feels towards S.R.B. It is not suggested that C.S.’s credibility is suspect; defence counsel does not suggest C.S. has any reason to lie about what S.R.B. told her or to exaggerate the extent of S.R.B.’s involvement in Miss Courtepatte’s death. The suggestion is rather that C.S.’s bias may have affected her understanding and her recollection of what S.R.B. said.

 

[30]            It is clear that there were difficulties in the relationship between C.S. and S.R.B. going back years, and that C.S. now feels no kinship with S.R.B., and was concerned when giving her evidence to let Miss Courtepatte’s family know that she did not condone what she believes S.R.B. has done. But, these are not factors that affect memory. C.S. expressed clear recollections about certain things that S.R.B. told her. She recalled how these statements came up in conversation. She recalled asking S.R.B., did you do certain things, and she recalled S.R.B.’s responses. She was also clear that there were other things that did not come up in their conversations, and some things that she asked S.R.B. about and S.R.B. did not respond. Defence counsel put to C.S. in cross-examination that C.S. had drawn conclusions from S.R.B.’s silences, and C.S. denied this. Her denial is given force by her evidence that regarding some matters S.R.B. did not give her any information. For example, during questioning, C.S. was asked:

 

Q.         What did she say to you about there not being a real party connected to Nina and K.B. - or Nina and the other girl?

 

[31]            She answered:

 

A.         Well, at one point she said they were going to go to a party at that time, and I asked, So you just lured this girl to go to a bush party when there is no party: And she didn’t say nothing. She didn’t respond to that answer.


[32]            I turn now to B.H.’s evidence about statements made by S.R.B. to her. B.H. was S.R.B.’s child and family services caseworker. She had taken over S.R.B.’s file from a previous caseworker in October or November 2004. As soon as she was advised through a duty report that S.R.B. was in custody at the Edmonton Young Offenders Centre, B.H. visited her and then continued to visit her, once or twice a month until S.R.B.’s Preliminary Inquiry in February 2006, and then with decreasing frequency until the spring of 2006. S.R.B.’s child services file was closed in October 2006.

 

[33]            The purpose of B.H.’s visits was to provide support to S.R.B.. She did not actively solicit information from S.R.B. about the alleged offences. B.H. testified that S.R.B. volunteered information to her during a number of visits. B.H. would respond by telling S.R.B. she did not want to hear this, and that would end the discussion for that visit, but S.R.B. would then volunteer information again during a later visit.

 

[34]            Again, defence counsel does not suggest that there is any issue regarding the credibility of B.H.’s testimony. She has no reason to lie and by all appearances was very aware of the significance of her evidence and took it very seriously. She was distressed by her memories of the discussions with S.R.B., saying they were things she could not forget. She appeared to be distressed by having to relate the discussions, but doing her best to answer carefully and honestly, stressing that she got only bits and pieces of information because she would stop S.R.B. from continuing to talk.

 

[35]            Defence counsel also argued that the memories of C.S., G.S. and B.H. could be affected by their exposure to extensive media coverage of this case, or by having heard evidence at a preliminary inquiry. This is a possibility regarding virtually all of the witnesses in this trial, but a possibility alone does not take away from the value of their sworn evidence.

 

[36]            B.H. testified that her knowledge came from S.R.B., not the media, and that she avoids media coverage because she finds it stressful. She also said that she believed the disclosures were made before the preliminary inquiry, and that her meetings with S.R.B. dwindled after the preliminary inquiry and ended a few months later. C.S. was aware of media coverage, in fact she testified to asking S.R.B. questions arising out of the coverage, and to S.R.B.’s answers, or failures to answer, those questions. Her evidence distinguished what she had heard in the media and what she heard from S.R.B. She was not asked questions about attendance at a preliminary inquiry or whether that may have affected her memory. G.S. made one reference to media coverage about Miss Courtepatte having been raped, but said that he did not discuss that with S.R.B. Again, his evidence distinguished between what he had heard from S.R.B., and what he had heard in media coverage. He also referred to going to a preliminary inquiry with S.R.B., adding that he did not believe she testified on that occasion. He was not asked whether attendance at the preliminary inquiry might have affected his memory.

 

[37]            The possibility that these witnesses’ memories might have been affected by exposure to media coverage or to evidence at a preliminary inquiry is not supported by the evidence.

 


[38]            Against that general background regarding the witnesses and their evidence, I will now review the evidence regarding the disputed facts. I will commence with the disputed issue with regard to which there is the largest amount of evidence, S.R.B. hitting or pushing Miss Courtepatte upon the arrival at the fairway. I will start with S.R.B.’s admissions to C.S. and G.S. and B.H. on this point.

 

[39]            C.S. testified that she talked to S.R.B. about this during their first visit at the Edmonton Young Offenders Centre. She said S.R.B. told her that she hit Miss Courtepatte on the forehead with a wrench. The wrench came from the trunk of Mr. Briscoe’s car. S.R.B. got it from the trunk and put it under her sleeve and walked toward the field. C.S. asked why S.R.B. did this, and S.R.B. said that she was forced to by Mr. Laboucan, and also said she did it to warn Miss Courtepatte.

 

[40]            G.S. testified that during one meeting, in response to questions from his wife, he heard S.R.B. say that when they were out in the country “Joe” handed her a tool and made her put it in her sleeve and carry it. On another occasion, when G.S. and S.R.B. were alone, he asked S.R.B. whether she hit the girl, and S.R.B. said she hit her once on the back with the tool.

 

[41]            B.H. testified that during her first or second visit with S.R.B., S.R.B. said that all she did was hit the girl in the back of the head with the wrench. B.H. recalled the words specifically, because her reaction was something like “What do you mean that’s all you did?”, but then she said she  did not want to hear any more or to know anything. B.H. also testified that S.R.B. said the wrench came from the trunk of the car.

 

[42]            I will now consider the eyewitness testimony on this point. K.B. testified that S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte somewhere on her back with a wrench. Afterwards Miss Courtepatte fell to the ground and started crying and saying what did I do. S.R.B. said that Miss Courtepatte was pissing her off. K.B. had not seen Miss Courtepatte do anything that would cause this. The wrench was about 18" to 2' long, with a socket on one end and a hook on the other. K.B. had not seen it before and did not know how it got there.

 

[43]            In cross-examination, K.B. admitted that when she was interviewed by the police, she said that S.R.B. only pushed Miss Courtepatte and that she did not see any weapons. It was not until S.R.B.’s preliminary inquiry that K.B. said Miss Courtepatte was hit with the wrench. In re-examination, K.B. said that she had initially said S.R.B. only pushed Miss Courtepatte, because S.R.B. had been nice to her. She confirmed that her present recollection is that S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte with a wrench.

 

[44]            D.T. testified that she saw S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte once or twice with her fists. Miss Courtepatte fell down, but did not stay down. She did not recall if S.R.B. said anything. D.T. confirmed on cross-examination that she was sure that no weapon was used. D.T. did give evidence that she saw a wrench of the same description given by K.B. later on, when Mr. Laboucan was using a wrench to choke Miss Courtepatte.

 


[45]            M.W. testified that he did not see S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte, but he saw Miss Courtepatte on the ground, with S.R.B. standing in front of her. Miss Courtepatte said, she hit me or she pushed me, and S.R.B. screamed, “You are pissing me off”. S.R.B. did not have anything in her hands at this point. He did see, earlier, a shape of something that appeared to be concealed in S.R.B.’s sleeve, a line coming down her sleeve. M.W. saw a wrench later, when Mr. Laboucan choked Miss Courtepatte with it. M.W. also testified that when they first arrived at the golf course, he saw S.R.B., Mr. Briscoe and Mr. Laboucan looking in the trunk of the car, but he did not see what they were doing there.

 

[46]            Mr. Briscoe stayed behind in the car for a time and later followed the others to the fairway. He did not see S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte, but he testified to hearing sounds as he was walking towards the area. He heard a noise, a whack or a thud like someone hitting somebody across the back with a hockey stick, and he heard a female voice scream. A few seconds later, he heard someone say, “Why did you do that?”

 

[47]            Mr. Briscoe also saw a wrench of the same description on the ground a short time later. He identified this as his wrench, from the trunk of his car. He also testified that when they first arrived at the golf course and got out of the car, he saw Mr. Laboucan digging around in the trunk of his car, and he thought that S.R.B. and M.W. were at the trunk at some point, as well.

 

[48]            The evidence leaves me with no doubt in my mind that S.R.B. did hit Miss Courtepatte with a wrench with enough force that it caused Miss Courtepatte to cry out and to stumble or fall. I also have no doubt that S.R.B. carried the wrench from the trunk of the car to the fairway, hidden in her sleeve. S.R.B. admitted this to C.S. and G.S. and to B.H., during their visits with her at the Edmonton Young Offender Centre that took place not long after her arrest. The admissions are consistent with each other, except that there is added detail in the admission to C.S. and G.S. regarding how the wrench got from the car to the fairway, and there are different descriptions of where Miss Courtepatte was hit, on the forehead or back of the head or back. There was less detail in the admission to B.H. because she told S.R.B. she  did not want to hear more.

 

[49]            I do not regard the differences as to whether the hit was on the head or the back as material. The admissions are consistent with the evidence of K.B. Further, although M.W. and Mr. Briscoe did not see a wrench, their evidence is still generally consistent with the admissions. The only witness who gave inconsistent evidence, who said that there was a hit but not with a weapon, was D.T., and even she did testify to seeing a wrench of the same description later on. D.T. may well have looked only after she heard a noise, as M.W. did, and saw no weapon at that moment, and concluded that there was none. This could be because S.R.B. dropped the wrench immediately after using it. This would accord with Mr. Briscoe’s evidence about seeing the wrench on the ground.

 


[50]            I move now to the disputed issue regarding whether S.R.B. knew that Mr. Laboucan planned to kidnap and kill Miss Courtepatte. I will consider at the same time the evidence on the related issue as to whether S.R.B. knew, when Mr. Laboucan in her presence invited Miss Courtepatte and K.B. to a party, and they left the mall together ostensibly headed to a party, that there was in fact no party.

 

[51]            Again, I commence with S.R.B.’s admissions. The evidence of C.S. on this point was that S.R.B. told her that, a couple of days before the murder of Miss Courtepatte, Mr. Laboucan said to her, “Somebody has to die today”. Mr. Briscoe was with her when Mr. Laboucan said this.

 

[52]            The evidence of B.H. was that S.R.B. told her that there was a time the night prior to the murder that S.R.B. and two other people, Mike and Joe, were driving around and Joe talked about wanting to kill someone. The next day, the three of them went to West Edmonton Mall to find somebody, and they found two girls near HMV, a music store. They all, including the two girls, got into a small car. In B.H.’s evidence, the following questions and answers are found:

 

Q.         Now, you had indicated earlier in you evidence as well that S.R.B. told you that they went to West Edmonton Mall to find someone?

A.         Yes.

Q.         Okay. Did she tell you, find someone to do what? What purpose were they going to find someone?

A.         To kill somebody.

Q.         Did she tell you that?

A.         Yes.

 

[53]            B.H. also testified that she was told that when they left West Edmonton Mall, the girls were told they were going to a rave, a party, but that there was no party. She believed that S.R.B. said that the party was Joe’s idea, and that he communicated this on the way to West Edmonton Mall.

 

[54]            As I indicated earlier, it is clear from the evidence, and the defence does not dispute, that Mr. Laboucan invited Miss Courtepatte and K.B. to a party, and that there was no party. S.R.B. was beside Mr. Laboucan when the invitation was first made, and was with him when they returned to the mall to pick up Miss Courtepatte and K.B. S.R.B. was described as smiling and giggling and laughing at the time, and happy in the car on the way to the supposed party, however, the evidence as to her mood does not assist me in determining her knowledge.

 

[55]            There was also evidence about discussions during the day on April 2nd about killing someone. Several witnesses remembered some joking about cutting peoples’ heads off and throwing them in the street. D.T. also described a time when J.S. was with the others in the car in the parking lot at the mall, and Mr. Laboucan took her and M.W. out of the car and aside, and asked her if she wanted to go kill someone with them. This conversation was observed, but not heard, by J.S. and Mr. Briscoe. D.T. said that Mr. Laboucan also talked about killing someone two or three times when they were all together in the car, including S.R.B. At some point, Mr. Laboucan said he had killed 180 people. She thought Mr. Laboucan was joking.

 


[56]            D.T. also testified to a conversation with S.R.B., that took place some time after the murder. S.R.B. told her that she knew about the plan before it happened, and that she and Mr. Laboucan had done this before. D.T. did not remember when the conversation took place, and agreed on cross examination that it might have been Mr. Laboucan who said they did it before.

 

[57]            None of this evidence about conversations clearly involves S.R.B., and much of it was of such a nature that it might be taken as a joke, as D.T. testified she took it. This evidence alone would not satisfy me of S.R.B.’s prior knowledge. But, to some degree, it confirms her admissions, and there is certainly nothing in this evidence that contradicts her admissions.

 

[58]            S.R.B.’s statement that when she learned of Mr. Laboucan’s plan, Mr. Briscoe was also there, is not supported by Mr. Briscoe’s evidence. However, this does not lead me to doubt the truth of S.R.B.’s admission. It may be that Mr. Briscoe’s evidence in this regard was not forthright, or that he was with them but did not hear Mr. Laboucan’s plan. This would be consistent with the description of his actions on April 2nd, when he was never too far away from S.R.B., but also was frequently not involved in the conversations of the younger people around him.

 

[59]            There was also evidence of conversation on the golf course, about rituals and killing people, that occurred before S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte. K.B. remembered S.R.B. taking part in this conversation.

 

[60]            In addition to S.R.B.’s admissions that she knew about a plan to kill, there is also the evidence of her actions at the golf course.

 

[61]            The evidence as a whole leaves me with no doubt that S.R.B. knew in advance that Mr. Laboucan had a plan to kill someone, and that when he, in her company, got Miss Courtepatte and K.B. to leave the mall to go to a party this was a pretext and a part of the plan. S.R.B. has not admitted specifically that she knew in advance that the party was not real, but she has admitted that she knew in advance that someone was to be killed and that was the real purpose for picking up these two individuals, Miss Courtepatte and K.B., on this specific occasion. This amounts, in my mind, to the same thing as admitting that she knew the party was not real. I am persuaded that both C.S. and B.H. recalled the admissions honestly and accurately. They were very clear admissions by S.R.B. that she knew about the plan in advance. I am also persuaded about the accuracy of these admissions by S.R.B.’s actions when she arrived at the golf course. Taking a wrench out the trunk, hiding it and taking it to the fairway, and hitting Miss Courtepatte with it, are actions that lead to a very strong inference that S.R.B. knew they were not going to a party. There is no explanation for these actions suggested by any of the evidence other than the explanation that arises from S.R.B.’s own admissions, that she knew in advance of the plan to kill, and that this was the occasion when that plan was to be implemented.

 

[62]            I move to the next area of dispute: whether S.R.B. did anything, and if so, what, in relation to a sexual assault on Miss Courtepatte.

 


[63]            S.R.B. admitted to both C.S. and B.H. that she held Miss Courtepatte’s arms or hands down while Miss Courtepatte was being sexually assaulted. C.S. said that she had heard about this in the media, and that when S.R.B. telephoned her that evening, she asked whether S.R.B. held Nina’s arms down while the boys were raping her. At first S.R.B. did not answer, and then C.S. said “S.R.B., answer me. Did you do that?” and S.R.B. said yes. C.S. asked her why, and S.R.B. said she was scared. B.H.’s evidence was that at one time S.R.B. disclosed to her that she had held the girl’s hands down while somebody was raping this young girl.

 

[64]            None of the eyewitnesses testified to seeing S.R.B. do this. However, Mr. Briscoe testified that soon after he arrived at the fairway, he heard Mr. Laboucan said “I’m going to fuck you”. Mr. Briscoe and S.R.B. were standing beside K.B., who was on the ground crying. Then, he thought he remembered Mr. Laboucan or M.W. say, come here, and S.R.B. went over to the group where there was a male lying on top of Miss Courtepatte. S.R.B. was gone for a short time, less than a minute, then she returned to K.B.’s side.

 

[65]            K.B.’s testimony was that S.R.B. was at her side for at least part of the time when she was on the ground. She remembers S.R.B. telling her that she passed out. But she also remembered Mr. Briscoe being beside her, and frightening her, while Mr. Laboucan was holding Miss Courtepatte on the ground.

 

[66]            The evidence convinces me that S.R.B. did hold Miss Courtepatte’s hand or arms down, for a brief time, while Miss Courtepatte was being sexually assaulted. There is no reasonable doubt in this regard. The admissions to both C.S. and B.H. were clear, and I am convinced both witnesses recalled these admissions honestly and accurately. There is no independent eyewitness evidence of S.R.B.’s actions, but Mr. Briscoe’s evidence confirms the admission to some extent, and K.B.’s evidence is not inconsistent with it.

 

[67]            The final area of evidence that I will review in detail is the evidence regarding S.R.B. and K.B. leaving the fairway of the golf course, and returning to the car. I will also review evidence regarding post-offence conduct.

 

[68]            K.B. testified that S.R.B. took her back to the car while everyone else stayed at the grassy area. Before they left, both Mr. Laboucan and S.R.B. talked about going to the car. She knows that S.R.B. wanted to take her there, because S.R.B. said, she doesn’t need to see this. I’m going to take her to the car.

 

[69]            K.B. testified that just before she and S.R.B. left, the last thing she remembered happening to Miss Courtepatte was that she was being held on the ground by one of the guys. She also testified that before they went back to the car, Miss Courtepatte came and gave her a hug.

 


[70]            K.B. remembered feeling very afraid, so scared she had trouble breathing. For part of the time, perhaps most of the time, she covered her face with her hands. She was freezing. She could not feel her fingers, her legs, or her face. She had a spinning feeling, probably before she realized she was on the ground. She  did not run away, because she could not move. She could not think about what to do next. She  did not know a safe place to run for help.

 

[71]            On the way back to the car, S.R.B. helped her to walk because she could not do that on her own. S.R.B. never hit her, pushed her, threatened her, or hurt her. She was the only one who was kind to her. When they got to the car, S.R.B. offered to share a cigarette with her and gave her some CDs, saying, Nina told me to give these to you.

 

[72]            After about 15 minutes the others came back to the car. D.T. pulled out two daggers and said she put them in her throat, and that she felt bad, but she wanted to do it again. K.B. recalled asking M.W. where Nina was, and he said they beat her up and made her run home naked. Mr. Laboucan opened the back door and yelled at S.R.B. to give him a bottle of water. S.R.B. asked why, and he yelled, “Look at me”. K.B. looked at him and he was covered in blood. When she saw this, she put her head in her arms.

 

[73]            They left after about five minutes, with Mr. Briscoe driving and Mr. Laboucan in the front passenger seat. Earlier, Mr. Laboucan had been sitting in the back and S.R.B. in the front. However, when Mr. Laboucan started to get into the back, S.R.B. looked at him and said, “I don’t think she wants anything to do with you right now”, and he said, “Yeah, that’s true”, so they switched spots.

 

[74]            Afterwards, K.B. thinks they went to a restaurant, and then she and S.R.B. were dropped off at the Windmill Motel while the others went out again. She remembered telling S.R.B. that she was scared, and S.R.B. telling her that she was going to be okay. S.R.B.  did not want to talk about what happened that night and  did not want to hear what everybody else had to say about it. She sounded angry and told people to shut up about it and stop talking. S.R.B. was not acting happy, as she had been earlier. K.B. testified that S.R.B. probably told her that she was scared.

 

[75]            D.T. testified that either during the time that Mr. Laboucan was raping Miss Courtepatte, or before, S.R.B. took K.B. to the car. She  did not remember whose idea it was, but she remembered that S.R.B. was trying to comfort K.B., and that S.R.B. took K.B. to the car because K.B. was cold and could not stand it. S.R.B. and K.B. did not return. When the others went to the car, they were there.

 

[76]            D.T. also gave evidence that, after dropping off S.R.B. and K.B. at the Windmill Hotel, and M.W. at his house, she and Mr. Laboucan and Mr. Briscoe drove around the Whyte Avenue area, and Mr. Laboucan said he had an adrenaline rush and wanted to do it again, and they spent some time looking for someone else to kill. Mr. Briscoe testified that the three of them drove around, all over the place, but did not refer to Whyte Avenue specifically or this conversation.

 


[77]            Mr. Briscoe remembered S.R.B. wanting to go to the car and to take K.B. She asked for the keys, at first he did not want to give them to her, but S.R.B. said “we’ve got to go to the car,  we’ve got to go to the car”. She said K.B. was cold. So he gave S.R.B. the keys and let them go. When S.R.B. and K.B. left, Miss Courtepatte was still alive. S.R.B. and K.B. were inside the car when the others returned.

 

[78]            M.W. testified that at some point while Mr. Laboucan was sexually assaulting Miss Courtepatte, S.R.B. and K.B. left. He saw them go and heard S.R.B. say, she doesn’t need to see this. It was his impression that S.R.B. was talking to all of them. Nobody answered her. They never came back.

 

[79]            After the others returned to car, M.W. recalled that they left the golf course and went to a Boston Pizza and did another dine and dash. Then they dropped off S.R.B. and K.B. at the Windmill Motel. Both S.R.B. and K.B. were quiet.

 

[80]            As I have already said, it is clear from this evidence that S.R.B. was not in the area when Miss Courtepatte was killed. I will not review in detail the evidence of what happened after they left. As I indicated earlier, Miss Courtepatte was sexually assaulted twice. Afterwards, she got up and put her clothes on, and then she was assaulted again, and beaten to death by blows to the head with a hammer or mallet, inflicted by Mr. Laboucan and M.W. I will return to this evidence when I review the defence of abandonment.

 

Part 2: The Offences Alleged Against S.R.B.:

 

[81]            I will now consider the offences with which S.R.B. is charged. I do not need to consider identity, or time or place, as all of these elements are clearly established. With regard to all of the charged offences, it is the position of the Crown that S.R.B. was a party to these offences because she aided or abetted the principal offender, Mr. Laboucan. Section 21(1) of the Code reads as follows:

 

21.(1)  Every one is a party to an offence who

(a)        actually commits it;

(b)        does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or

(c)        abets any person in committing it.

 

[82]            The Code does not create separate offences for a principal, the person who actually commits the crime, and an aider or abettor. They all have the same responsibility for the same offence.

 

[83]            In order to convict S.R.B. as a party to an offence through aiding, the Crown must prove the following essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

 

(i)         that the principal offender, Mr. Laboucan, is guilty of the offence;

(ii)        that S.R.B. committed an act or failed to do something which she had a legal duty to do that aided Mr. Laboucan in committing the offence; and


(iii)      that S.R.B. intended her act to aid Mr. Laboucan in the commission of the offence.

 

[84]            To convict S.R.B. as an abettor, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, again that Mr. Laboucan is guilty of the offence, and that S.R.B. encouraged the commission of the crime, either through words or conduct, and that the encouragement was intentional.

 

[85]            In order to show intention, it is not necessary to show that S.R.B. desired or approved of the consequences, only that she intended the consequences of her words or actions.

 

[86]            To be convicted of an offence as an aider or abettor, something more than mere presence at the scene of a crime is required. That something can be found through acts of encouragement, acts that facilitate the commission of the offence, acts that prevent or hinder interference with the offence, or attendance at the commission of the offence with prior knowledge of the principal offender’s intention to commit the offence.

 

Kidnapping

 

[87]            S.R.B. is charged with kidnapping. Kidnapping requires the movement or taking of a victim from one place to another, with intent to confine or imprison that person. Unlawful confinement means that the victim is physically restrained, deprived of his or her liberty to move from one place to another. There does not have to be a forceful taking or movement. That can be accomplished by fraudulent inducement or stratagem.

 

[88]            The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the principal offender, Mr. Laboucan, is guilty of kidnapping Miss Courtepatte. He has been convicted of it, and the evidence in this trial supports that conclusion. Mr. Laboucan took Miss Courtepatte to the golf course through the fraudulent inducement or stratagem of a party, and confined her there by holding her down while he sexually assaulted and murdered her.

 

[89]            Did S.R.B. intentionally do something to aid or encourage the commission of that offence? I conclude that it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that S.R.B. both aided and abetted the kidnapping of Miss Courtepatte.

 

[90]            S.R.B. was beside Mr. Laboucan when the invitation to the party was first made, and when they returned to the mall to pick up Miss Courtepatte and K.B. She walked out of the mall beside them. She was happy in the mall, and in the car talking with others about the supposed party. As I concluded earlier, the evidence as a whole leaves me with no doubt that S.R.B. knew in advance that Mr. Laboucan had a plan to kill someone, and that when he, in her company, got Miss Courtepatte and K.B. to leave the mall to go to a party this was a pretext and a part of the plan. S.R.B. was not only present but knowingly participated in the stratagem to induce Miss Courtepatte to go with Mr. Laboucan.

 

 


Aggravated Sexual Assault

 

[91]            S.R.B. is charged with aggravated sexual assault. In order for a person to be found guilty of aggravated sexual assault, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:

 

(i)         the accused applied force to another person

(ii)        the application of force was intentional

(iii)      the other person did not consent

(iv)      the accused knew the other person did not consent

(v)        the application of force was of a sexual nature, and

(vi)      the accused wounded, maimed, disfigured or endangered the life of the other person in committing the sexual assault.

 

[92]            In this case there are two principal offenders, Mr. Laboucan and M.W. The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the principal offenders committed aggravated sexual assault. Mr. Laboucan was convicted of this and M.W. admitted that he sexually assaulted Miss Courtepatte. After she was sexually assaulted Miss Courtepatte was choked with a wrench and beaten by both Mr. Laboucan and M.W. The beating occurred immediately after the sexual assault, and followed as a part of the same transaction, so that the wounding of Miss Courtepatte was caused by the principals in committing the sexual assault.

 

[93]            Did S.R.B. intentionally do something to aid or encourage the commission of that offence? I conclude that it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that S.R.B. aided or abetted the aggravated sexual assault on Miss Courtepatte. I have already concluded that it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that she held Miss Courtepatte’s hands or arms down while Miss Courtepatte was being sexually assaulted. While the evidence indicates that she did this for a brief time only, the nature of the act is such that it obviously aided or encouraged the commission of the offence, and S.R.B. would have to have known this at the time, and thus to have intended to aid or encourage as a natural consequence of her act.

 

First Degree Murder

 

[94]            Finally, S.R.B. is charged with the first degree murder of Miss Courtepatte. In order to consider the offence of first degree murder, it is necessary first to consider culpable homicide generally, then murder generally, and finally first degree murder.

 

[95]            The Criminal Code stipulates that a person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death of a human being. A person commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act. Culpable homicide is murder or manslaughter or infanticide.

 


[96]            Culpable homicide is murder where the requisite intent for murder is proven, that being, where the person who causes the death of a human being, means to cause his death or means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death and is reckless whether death ensues or not.

 

[97]            Where murder is established, the remaining question is whether it is first degree murder or second degree murder.

 

[98]            Again, the Crown’s theory is not that S.R.B. committed the offence as a principal, but that she aided or abetted Mr. Laboucan to commit the offence.

 

[99]            It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Laboucan, as the principal, committed first degree murder. He caused Miss Courtepatte’s death by an unlawful act, assaulting her and beating her to death. In beating her as he did he clearly intended to cause her death or bodily harm that he knew was likely to result in her death, and he was reckless as to whether or not death ensued. He is guilty of first degree murder in two ways. The murder was planned and deliberate as defined in s. 231(2) of the Code, and it was committed during the commission of a domination offence under s. 231(5) of the Code.

 

[100]         Did S.R.B. intentionally do something to aid or encourage the commission of murder? If so, did she aid or abet a planned and deliberate murder? Alternatively, did she aid or abet a murder committed during the commission of a domination offence? If she was a party to murder under s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code, not s. 231(2), in order for her to be guilty of first degree murder on this ground it would also have to be shown that her own actions were an essential, substantial and integral cause of Miss Courtepatte’s death. This special causation requirement comes from the Supreme Court of Canada case of R. v. Harbottle, 1993 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 306, and applies only to first degree murder under s. 231(5), not to planned and deliberate first degree murder under s. 231(2).

 

[101]         S.R.B. did a number of acts that aided or encouraged Mr. Laboucan’s commission of the offence of murder. I have already found that she aided or abetted in his commission of the underlying domination offences of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. She also took a wrench from the car and transported it secretly to the fairway of the golf course. Finally, she assaulted Miss Courtepatte with the wrench. There is no evidence that this assault directly caused bodily harm to Miss Courtepatte. But it would be unrealistic to consider S.R.B.’s assault out of context, as simply one hit with a wrench that caused Miss Courtepatte to stumble or fall. It must be looked at in the context of what had already happened and what S.R.B. knew at the time. Looked at in that context it was an assault that occurred after Miss Courtepatte had been lured to a lonely place, in the presence of other persons including Mr. Laboucan, when S.R.B. knew that Mr. Laboucan had a plan to kill someone at that time. In that context, S.R.B.’s assault is not an individual act, but the beginning of a joint assault that was intended to and did cause Miss Courtepatte’s death.

 


[102]         But just as it would be unrealistic to consider S.R.B.’s assault out of context in terms of what happened before, it would also be unrealistic to consider it out of context in terms of what happened after. Shortly after the assault, S.R.B. focused her attention on K.B., who had fallen to the ground and was cold and terrified. And soon after that, while Miss Courtepatte was being sexually assaulted but before any deadly force had been used against her, S.R.B. left the area with K.B. and did not return. The evidence suggests that S.R.B. did this to help K.B., not to facilitate the commission of the offence against Miss Courtepatte. K.B. was not interfering with the commission of the offence, and by all accounts no one would have expected her to do so. From terror and shock and the cold, she was incapable of interfering.

 

[103]         I must consider S.R.B.’s intention not only when she performed the aiding or encouraging acts, but also when the offence was committed, when Miss Courtepatte was killed. Mr. Laboucan was not convicted of first degree murder just because of a plan to kill, and steps taken to implement the plan, he was convicted because he carried the plan all the way through to the final commission of the offence. Mr. Laboucan could have had a change of heart, and if he had, Miss Courtepatte would in all likelihood be alive today and Mr. Laboucan would not be convicted of first degree murder. Just as a principal offender can have a change of heart, so can an aider or abettor. The legal rule that deals with a change of heart, and that sets the requirements for what must occur before a change of heart will relieve an aider or abettor of criminal liability, is the defence of abandonment.


[115]         Once the air of reality test is met, the question becomes whether or not the defence is persuasive. At this point, the accused does not bear any type of burden. The Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that even with respect to "affirmative" defences, including alibi, duress, provocation and others, the accused has no persuasive burden. Once the issue has been "put in play" the defence will succeed unless it is disproved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

[116]         The Crown argues that S.R.B.’s actions were no more than leaving the scene, and that a mere change of mental intention and quitting of the scene of the crime just prior to the striking of the fatal blow is not sufficient or timely communication. But S.R.B. did more than leave, she communicated to everyone present, including Mr. Laboucan, that she was leaving and why she was leaving. The evidence of K.B. was that Mr. Laboucan spoke to S.R.B., and was aware that they were leaving. The evidence of Mr. Briscoe, M.W. and D.T. was that they knew that S.R.B. was leaving, she told them this and she told them she was taking K.B. to the car because K.B. was cold and did not need to see this. Is there at least a reasonable doubt that this was sufficient to communicate to the others that, if they proceeded, they did so without the further aid and assistance of S.R.B.?

 

[117]         I have already held that, in my view, the evidence supports the view that S.R.B. left to help K.B., not to facilitate the commission of the offence against Miss Courtepatte. In my view the evidence does raise a reasonable doubt that S.R.B. communicated to all of the others, including Mr. Laboucan, that she was no longer a part of what was occurring on the fairway, that if they proceeded, they did so without her further aid and assistance. I have a reasonable doubt that implicitly, although not explicitly, S.R.B. communicated and the others understood, that she would not assist them further. Whitehouse, supra, refers to unequivocal notice; I have a reasonable doubt that S.R.B.’s communication was unequivocal, that the others did not expect her to return or provide further assistance.

 

[118]         This conclusion is strengthened by the evidence of post-offence conduct. There was evidence that, after the return to the car, there was talk about what had happened, and even about doing it again. There is no evidence that S.R.B. participated in any of these conversations, and K.B. recalled that S.R.B. did not seem happy,  did not want to talk about what happened, and  did not want to hear what everybody else had to say about it.

 

[119]         Thus I have a reasonable doubt that the communication was sufficient and unequivocal, was it also timely? First of all, I note that the abandonment was certainly not timely so far as the kidnapping or aggravated sexual assault offences were concerned. The kidnapping had already occurred; the sexual assault was taking place. The defence is not successful regarding those offences.

 

[120]         Was the abandonment timely in relation to the murder?

 

[121]         The real issue regarding timeliness is whether the abandonment took place at a time when it could have had an effect. Attempted abandonments that are too late to have any effect, when the offence has already been or is already being committed, do not provide a defence. It is not that the person who abandons must actually succeed in stopping the offence, that is clear, but there must be a possibility that the abandonment could have an effect.


[122]         In my view, the abandonment was timely so far as the murder was concerned. When S.R.B. communicated her withdrawal, no one had yet applied force that was intended to cause Miss Courtepatte’s death, or that was intended to cause her bodily harm likely to result in her death. When S.R.B. hit her with the wrench, Miss Courtepatte either only stumbled, or, if she fell, she got up again quickly. Even after the sexual assault, the evidence is that Miss Courtepatte got up and dressed herself. The Crown’s case is that her death was caused by blows to the head with a mallet or sledgehammer, and the evidence is that those blows occurred after the sexual assaults, and after S.R.B. had left the scene. S.R.B.’s abandonment at the time that she communicated it, could have had an effect. To the extent that Mr. Laboucan and the others were encouraged by her presence and assistance, they could have been discouraged by her communication that she no longer wanted to be a part of what was happening.

 

[123]         The defence of abandonment gives effect to a change of heart, or more precisely, a change of intention, if notice of the abandonment is communicated in a sufficient, unequivocal and timely way. S.R.B. knew that Mr. Laboucan planned to kill Miss Courtepatte, and she intended to assist him when she participated in the kidnapping, took the wrench to the fairway, and hit Miss Courtepatte with it. Although she may have been reluctant, she still had the intent to assist in the commission of sexual assault when she held Miss Courtepatte’s arms or hands down. But afterwards, before any deadly force was directed at Miss Courtepatte, S.R.B. withdrew from the scene and communicated to others that she was leaving to care for K.B. These actions give rise to a reasonable doubt that she gave sufficient, unequivocal and timely notice to the others that, if they continued, it would be without her further aid or assistance. Due to the defence of abandonment, effect is given to S.R.B.’s change of intention. Thus it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that at the essential time, when the offence of first degree murder was committed by Mr. Laboucan, S.R.B. had the specific intent to assist Mr. Laboucan to cause Miss Courtepatte’s death or to cause her bodily harm likely to result in death. This means she is not guilty of murder. It is unnecessary to consider the distinction between first and second degree murder. However, there still remains the issue of whether S.R.B. is guilty of the included offence of manslaughter.

 

Manslaughter

 

[124]         Was the abandonment timely in relation to the included offence of manslaughter? Although I have found that S.R.B. was no longer a party to the murder when it occurred, was she a party to manslaughter?

 

[125]         To prove that a person has committed manslaughter, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person has committed culpable homicide, in other words, that the person has caused the death of a human being, and has done so by means of an unlawful act. Further, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite mens rea. For unlawful act manslaughter, the requisite mens rea is objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, in the context of a dangerous act. Foreseeability of the risk of death is not required.


[126]         Did S.R.B. aid or abet Mr. Laboucan to commit the offence of manslaughter? Of course, Mr. Laboucan did not commit manslaughter, he committed first degree murder. But the Supreme Court of Canada held in Kirkness, supra, that an aider and abettor can be convicted of manslaughter, even though the principal offender is convicted of murder. The Court said [at paragraph 20]:

 

In the case of an accused who aids or abets in the killing of another, the requisite intent that the aider or abettor must have in order to warrant a conviction for murder must be the same as that required of the person who actually does the killing. That is to say, the person aiding or abetting the crime must intend that death ensue or intend that he or the perpetrator cause body harm of a kind likely to result in death and be reckless whether death ensues or not. If the intent of the aiding party is insufficient to support a conviction for murder, then that party might still be convicted of manslaughter if the unlawful act which was aided or abetted is one he or she knows is likely to cause some harm short of death.

 

[127]         The Edwards case is an example where the accused were found to have abandoned their aiding and abetting of the offence of murder, but were still found guilty of manslaughter. Because of the timely notice of abandonment, the Crown had not proven the requisite intent for murder, but it had proven the ingredients of the offence of manslaughter, arising from the accused’s participation in the first part of the assault.

 

[128]         Has it been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that S.R.B. aided Mr. Laboucan in causing the death of Miss Courtepatte, by means of an unlawful act, with the requisite mens rea, objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, in the context of a dangerous act?

 

[129]         I find that the elements of the offence of manslaughter have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that S.R.B.’s abandonment was not timely insofar as this offence is concerned. S.R.B. aided and abetted at least two unlawful and dangerous acts that gave rise to objective foreseeabililty of the risk of bodily harm to Miss Courtepatte that was neither trivial nor transitory. First of all, S.R.B. knew that Mr. Laboucan planned to kill a kidnapping victim, so when she aided in the kidnapping she was aiding in an unlawful and dangerous act that gave rise to objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm to Miss Courtepatte that was neither trivial nor transitory. Secondly, when S.R.B. hit Miss Courtepatte with the wrench she committed another unlawful act. There is no evidence that this hit itself caused bodily harm to Miss Courtepatte, but the hit was not only an individual assault by S.R.B., it also aided and abetted a joint assault on S.R.B., and that joint assault was another unlawful and dangerous act that gave rise to objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm to Miss Courtepatte that was neither trivial nor transitory. Either of these unlawful acts was a significant contributing cause of Miss Courtepatte’s death.

 


[130]         S.R.B.’s abandonment of the offence of murder, and her lack of the specific intent associated with murder subsequent to that abandonment, does not affect her responsibility for manslaughter. The abandonment was not timely so far as manslaughter is concerned. It was too late, the unlawful act was done, the objective risk of harm was present, and Miss Courtepatte’s death followed as a result.

 

Duress

 

[131]         There is one more defence to be considered, the defence of duress.  The defence of duress or compulsion under s. 17 of the Criminal Code does not apply to parties to an offence, but the common law defence of duress may apply. Where there is an air of reality to the defence, the onus is on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the three essential elements of the defence is not present: R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24 (CanLII), 2001 1 SCR 687 at para. 100.

 

[132]         The elements of the defence of duress are:

 

(i)         clear and imminent danger;

(ii)        absence of any reasonable legal alternative to breaking the law, also referred to as a safe avenue of escape. A safe avenue of escape is assessed on an objective basis, but taking into account the particular circumstances and human frailties of the accused; and

(iii)      proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided, in the sense that the harm avoided must be either comparable to or greater than the harm inflicted.

 

[133]         There was very little evidence about duress. Mr. Briscoe testified that sometime during the day S.R.B. mentioned that Mr. Laboucan wanted to hurt her or something. K.B. testified that S.R.B. probably said she was scared. This would have been after the commission of the offence. S.R.B. in her statements to C.S. said that Joe forced her to hit Miss Courtepatte, that she was scared when she held Miss Courtepatte’s arms down, and that she feared for her life, too. S.R.B. did not make similar statements to B.H.

 

[134]         The evidence leaves me with no reasonable doubt that, if S.R.B. was in danger, she had a safe avenue of escape. Her knowledge of the plan went back to at least the night before Ms. Courtepatte’s murder. There were many times during the day on April 2nd that S.R.B. was apart from Mr. Laboucan, with other persons, and in a very large and public area, the West Edmonton Mall. S.R.B. was familiar with the mall and the city. I have no doubt that she had many safe avenues of escape after she learned of Mr. Laboucan’s plan and before she aided and abetted his commission of the offences. Even at the golf course, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that S.R.B. could not have remained at the car with Mr. Briscoe, or that she could not have withdrawn and returned to the car, as she indeed eventually did, earlier. The defence of duress does not apply.
