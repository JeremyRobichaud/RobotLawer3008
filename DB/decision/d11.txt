CONCLUSION

                                    The jury should never have learned about the appellant's rape of his sister R.R.2.  That evidence was so highly prejudicial to the appellant that it deprived him of his right to a fair trial.  I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial.  In view of this disposition, it is unnecessary to consider the appeal against sentence.
