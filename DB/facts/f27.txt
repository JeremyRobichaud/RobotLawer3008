FACTS NOT IN DISPUTE

[7]                       I heard evidence from Ms. N., Mr. M., M. K., a friend of Ms. N.’s and, D. N., Ms. N.’s father, and from the defendant and his mother, Mrs. M. H..

[8]                       Certain facts emerged at trial which were agreed upon, or not challenged by opposing counsel:

 

1.                  The defendant and Ms. N. were in a romantic relationship from June 23, 2009 to November 12, 2010.

2.                  The defendant terminated the relationship.

3.                  Ms. N. was very upset that he terminated the relationship.

4.                  During the relationship, there were occasions on which Ms. N. held the defendant, either attempting to restrain him when he wanted to leave her company, or attempting to comfort him if she believed he was in distress.

5.                  On some occasions, the defendant found this attention unwanted, and pushed Ms. N. away.  

6.                  The defendant suffers from ADHD, and has had difficulties with impulse control. He has been receiving psychological treatment for a lengthy period of time.

7.                  The defendant when angry:

•        has thrown objects

•         has punched walls

•         has broken windows

•         broke Ms. N.’s cellphone

•         damaged Ms. N.’s  ring

(This behaviour was described by the defendant’s mother in her cross-examination.)

 

[9]                       The defendant did not defend the assault charges against him by alleging that he acted in self-defence, to repel unwanted touching by Ms. N..

THE EVIDENCE

 

Assault between April 1-30, 2010

[10]                   Ms. N. initially testified that the first time the defendant assaulted her was in the spring, April or May, of 2010, when the defendant struck her in the face while in the company of his friends. She said that the assault “probably” occurred because she had said something that angered him.  Much later in her evidence, she said that she now recalled that this assault happened in August 2009. She testified that this was hard to remember, as it happened so long ago.

[11]                  The defendant denies that this assault occurred. There were no other witnesses.

Assault causing bodily harm, sometime between August 1-31, 2009

[12]                  Ms. N. testified that, on a rainy night in August 2009, after leaving a party at which they had argued, the defendant hit her with an umbrella, cutting her head. Her jacket was ripped, and blood stained her purse. Ms. N. testified that the defendant was apologetic, and stayed with her that evening; the next day when she and he went to his mother’s home, she told Mrs. H. the story that they had agreed upon-- that she had cut her head when falling on a bus. She asked Mrs. H. to look at her head, and advise whether she needed stitches.

[13]                  The defendant agreed that he and Ms. N. had been at a party that evening and had argued, that Ms. N. had a cut on her head, and that Ms. N. told his mother that she injured herself in an accident involving a bus.  His testimony on how that injury occurred changed during his evidence:

•        Initially, he said that he and Ms. N. were on a bus; that the bus stopped abruptly, and that Ms. N. hit her head; that she got off the bus, but he stayed on. It wasn’t raining, and he had no umbrella.

•        On cross-examination (which occurred some days after his evidence in chief), the defendant testified that it was raining, and that Ms. N. got off the bus before him. He didn’t see any fall or accident.  The next day, Ms. N. came to his house and showed his mother a cut on her head. He wasn’t sure how she sustained the cut; “things can happen when I’m not around”.

[14]                  Mrs. H.’s evidence was that she recalled being home with the defendant  one day when Ms. N. came to their home, concerned about a cut on her head and asking for her opinion as to whether she needed stitches. Mrs. H. found the cut to be superficial, and wondered why Ms. N. was calling attention to it.

Assault on or about December 25, 2009
[15]                  Ms. N.’s evidence details a prolonged assault at a time which she described as “Christmas time”, 2009. She testified that on the evening in question, she and the defendant finished work at No Frills, and went to her home, where they were alone, as her father was at work. An argument started.  According to Ms. N., the defendant pushed her into a mirror in the kitchen, and the mirror broke; the defendant struck her several times in the face; the assault moved into the bathroom, where the defendant struck her in the face again; the defendant then struck her on her temple with a closed fist, and she fell backwards, hitting her head on the toilet bowl. Ms. N. was dizzy, and believed that she had a concussion. She did not go to the doctor, fearful that their parents would learn of the assault. Ms. N. testified that the defendant cared for her that evening. She and the defendant went to a hotel, as she feared discovery by her father when he returned from work. 

[16]                  The defendant denies that this assault occurred. He testified that he was at home on December 25, 2009, and that Ms. N. was not with him. He is corroborated by his mother in this evidence.  Mrs. H. also testified that on Boxing Day, 2009, Ms. N. visited their home, and that she participated actively in a family party, showing no signs of dizziness or ill-health.  In cross-examination, although Ms. N. did not agree with the evidence of the defendant and his mother as to her whereabouts on December 25th and 26th, she did not allege that the assault took place on those days. [1] She was not questioned further as to when the alleged assault had occurred.

Assault sometime between October 14-31, 2010

[17]                  Ms. N. testified that the last time that the defendant assaulted her before the termination of their relationship was on the evening of October 30 or 31st, 2010. She recalls that it was on or near Halloween. She testified that she and the defendant were lying on her bed in her bedroom, watching TV, and “something set him off”. He backhanded her across the face, hitting her on the nose. Her nose began bleeding, and blood dropped on to her duvet cover. Ms. N. recalls showing her blood-stained duvet to Mr. M., but only after charges were laid against the defendant.

[18]                  Mr. M.’s evidence is that during the same time period, Ms. N. called him one evening in distress, and he went to her home.  He saw that there was a mark beside her left nostril, and a cut and a bruise under her nose.  He also observed what appeared to be a bloodstain on her duvet cover.

[19]                  Mr. N. testified that he had not seen any bloodstain on his daughter’s duvet cover during this time. 

[20]                  The defendant denies that this incident occurred.

 

Contextual evidence

[21]                  Ms. N. also gave evidence about her relationship with the defendant, and about numerous alleged assaults other than those alleged in the information.  According to Ms. N., she and the defendant concocted stories to explain the scratches and bruises she suffered, if questions were asked by their parents or others. As set out above, the defendant flatly denies any assaults on Ms. N.

[22]                  No objection was taken by defence counsel to the evidence from Ms. N. about other alleged assaults.  In fact, counsel in cross-examination elicited evidence from Ms. N. about further alleged assaults, in an attempt to impeach her credibility for not reporting these assaults to police at her first interview.

[23]                  In my view, this evidence was admissible to establish the context of the relationship between Ms. N. and the defendant[2].  This evidence was not properly admissible to establish that the defendant was of bad character or that he had a propensity for assaultive behaviour, and I did not consider it for that purpose.

[24]                  I will set out two of the additional allegations of assault against Ms. N.. The first incident is alleged to have taken place in August, 2010, a few days before Ms. N. and the defendant were scheduled to visit a cottage rented by his family. Ms. N. testified that in the course of an argument, the defendant punched her hard in her right bicep. A large, dark bruise, the size of her palm, developed.  Ms. N. and the defendant did go to the cottage for a week, and she then returned to Toronto. Her evidence is that when anyone asked about the bruise, she explained that it was the result of a boating accident.

 

[25]                  S.M. testified that he noted a large dark bruise on Ms. Nixon’s right bicep in August 2010, after she had returned from the cottage vacation. He testified that, when questioned by co-workers, Ms. Nixon claimed that she sustained the bruise in a boating mishap at the cottage. Mr. Muir did not believe this, and confronted her later; she admitted that the bruise came from an assault by the defendant.

[26]                  Mr. N. also noted a large bruise on his daughter’s right bicep upon her return from the cottage that August.  He testified that he did not believe his daughter’s explanation that she injured herself while tubing; he had been tubing, and found the location of the bruise improbable. However, he did not question her further.

[27]                  The defendant denies the incident entirely. 

[28]                  Mrs. H. testified that she and her husband entertained approximately 19 guests, including many children, while at the cottage that week in August. She did not notice a large bruise or a bruise of any type on Ms. N. while at the cottage, and was unaware of any boating accident.

[29]                  The second incident is alleged to have occurred in October, 2010. The defendant and Ms. N. both agreed in their evidence that the defendant called Ms. N. while she was at school, asking that she bring him his medication at work; she did so, accompanied by M.K. The defendant came out to the street to meet Ms. N., and Ms. K. waited across the street while Ms. N. delivered the medication. Ms. N. testified that the defendant was angry, and bit her on the shoulder. Ms. K. observed what appeared to be an argument between the defendant and Ms. N.; although she did not overhear what was said, and she did not observe the interaction continuously.  She observed Ms. N. put her arms around the defendant, and the defendant push Ms. N. away and leave.  When Ms. N. rejoined Ms. K., she noted that there was what appeared to be a bite mark on her shoulder, an injury that had not been there previously.

[30]                  The defendant denies the assault. He initially testified that he was not even angry with Ms. N. that day. However, as he was cross-examined about the incident, he became visibly angry, complaining that Ms. N.  had allowed her friend M. K. to accompany her and thus to know about his medication.
