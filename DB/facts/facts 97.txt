II.        Background Facts
[5]               Omar Ahmed Khadr, a Canadian citizen, applied for habeas corpus, alleging that his imprisonment in a federal institution is unlawful.  At issue is which penal system, federal or provincial, does Canadian legislation direct that he serve the remainder of his sentence.  His application sought to have the Respondent, Ms. Hartle, Warden of the Edmonton Institution, release him immediately on the basis that he was unlawfully detained. 

[6]               Mr. Khadr, a former detainee at the US Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GTMO), was sentenced to eight years confinement following his guilty plea under a Plea Agreement (filed with the materials) to five serious offences: murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, participation in the activities of a terrorist group, and spying for the enemy, all committed when he was 15 years old.  Under the Plea Agreement, he agreed to plead guilty and in return the United States Convening Authority for Military Commissions (the Convening Authority) agreed to approve no sentence greater than eight years and to take action to facilitate Mr. Khadr’s transfer to Canada, after one year, to serve the remainder of his sentence.

[7]               Mr. Khadr was transferred to Canada in accordance with the Treaty Between Canada and the United States of America on the Execution of Penal Sentences (the Treaty), and the related Canadian legislation, the International Transfer of Offenders Act, SC 2004, c 21 (ITOA).  Under s. 20 of the ITOA a Canadian who is now an adult, but who was between 12 and 17 at the time of the offence, and whose sentence, imposed by a foreign entity, could have been a youth sentence under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, SC 2002, c 1 (YCJA), if the offence had been committed in Canada, is to be detained in a provincial correctional facility for adults. It further provides that if the sentence could have been an adult sentence, then the offender is to be detained in a penitentiary. Section 21 of the ITOA provides that if the sentence is greater than two years, the sentence is to be served in a penitentiary.
