21(2) Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

Introduction and Some Words of Warning

[22]                     The defence of duress[1] recognizes that, subject to certain rules, a person who commits an offence under the compulsion of a threat of death or bodily harm made by another, will not be held criminally liable.  The defence is seen as a “concession to human frailty” (Reg v Howe, [1987] AC 417 (HL)).  As Monnin JA (as he then was) explained in R v Bergstrom (1980), 1980 CanLII 3120 (MB CA), 2 ManR (2d) 121 (CA), aff’d 1981 CanLII 188 (SCC), [1981] 1 SCR 539, “The basic idea behind the defence of duress is that duress makes the act committed involuntary” (at para 15).  To that description I would add that the involuntariness is of a moral (sometimes called normative) nature.  Professor Dennis Baker explains that, “The defence is allowed not because it achieves the greater good or lesser evil but because the defendant acts without a fully unfettered freedom” (Dennis J Baker, Textbook of Criminal Law, 3rd ed (London, UK:  Sweet & Maxwell, 2012) at 867).

[23]                     Despite its ancient pedigree dating back until at least the 14th century in England, the defence of duress has been seen as “an extremely vague and elusive juristic concept” (Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v Lynch, [1975] AC 653 (HL) at 686).  This is partly because of historical reasons, the infrequency of it arising and also due to the fact that it involves a multiplicity of seemingly conflicting interests.  As LeBel J explained in R v Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 SCR 687 (at para 58):

Duress involves the resolution of conflicts between individual rights and duties to others or obligations as a citizen.  The analysis and determination of the rules governing duress should not take place in a vacuum where courts would focus only on the position and rights of the threatened party.  The rights of third parties, more particularly the intended victims, may also be involved.  The interest of the State or society in the preservation of public order and the proper application of laws will also be engaged.

 

[24]                     The essential features of the defence of duress are more certain.  Absent statutory language to the contrary, duress does not operate to negate any legal element of an offence; it only raises a new issue in a trial once the requirements of an offence are proven.  An accused has an evidentiary burden to raise the defence, but once there is an air of reality to it, the Crown has the burden of negating the defence, otherwise the accused will be acquitted.

[25]                     In Canada, two forms of the defence are recognized.  The first being a statutory one, as set out in section 17 of the Code, that applies to those whose liability for an offence is that of a principal or co-principal (section 21(1)(a) of the Code).  The other is the common law version of the defence, which is continued by section by 8(3) of the Code, and is reserved for those whose liability for an offence is that of a party (sections 21(1)(b)-(c) or 21(2) of the Code).  In light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ryan, the two different forms of the defence are now almost identical, save for the list of statutory exclusions to the defence in section 17 and the principal/party distinction (see Ryan at paras 81-84).  Finally, the defence of duress is closely related conceptually to the defence of necessity (see Lynch at pp 668, 670, 692, 709-11; R v Hibbert, 1995 CanLII 110 (SCC), [1995] 2 SCR 973 at paras 19-20, 23, 45, 54; R v Cinous, 2002 SCC 29 at para 57, [2002] 2 SCR 3; Ruzic at paras 64, 71, 100; Ryan at paras 23, 36, 42, 74; and Perka et al v The Queen, 1984 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 232 at 255-56).

[26]                     Some criminal defences are rationalized and distinguished from others by characterizing them as either “justifications” or “excuses” (Perka at p 246).  A justification challenges the wrongfulness of the action; the law views the action as rightful in the circumstances.  An excuse concedes that the act is wrongful, but the law does not hold the actor accountable because of the circumstances under which the act was done (see Perka at pp 246-47).

[27]                     Professor George Fletcher describes the defence of duress as a “paradigmatic example of an excuse” (George P Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (New York:  Oxford University Press, 2000) at 830).  While the language Parliament uses to describe a defence in a statute is not necessarily determinative of its true juristic nature, in the case of duress, since it was introduced into the Code in 1892, the statutory language has consistently referred to it as an excuse for the commission of an offence (see Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4 at paras 64-65, [2004] 1 SCR 76; and Gary P Rodrigues, ed, Crankshaw’s Criminal Code of Canada,  RSC 1985, (Toronto:  Thomson Reuters, 2016) vol 1, (loose-leaf revision 16-1) at 1-185 - 1-186).

[28]                     Serious discussion of duress as a recognized defence in the common law began with the influential writings of Sir Matthew Hale, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench (1671-1676) (see Matthew Hale, Historia Placitorum Coronæ:  The History of the Pleas of the Crown (London, UK:  E and R Nutt & R Gosling, 1736) vol 1 (reprinted London, UK:  Professional Books, 1971) at 49-52 (hereafter Hale)).  One feature of Hale’s articulation of the defence of duress is that the law excludes duress as a defence to the offence of murder (Hale at p 51).  Hale’s rule was the common law in Canada prior to the enactment of the Code in 1892 (see Henri Elzéar Taschereau, The Criminal Code of the Dominion of Canada as amended in 1893, with Commentaries, Annotations, Precedents of Indictments; &c., &c. (Toronto:  Carswell, 1893) at 10).

[29]                     In this appeal, the Court is asked to address the constitutionality of the law passed by Parliament in 1892 codifying, in what is now section 17 of the Code, the common law rule articulated by Hale that the law will never excuse the murder of an innocent person based on a claim of duress.

[30]                     A related point is that the facts of this case are that the accused was charged with murder as a principal, not a party.  While the modern view of the criminal law is that there are not different degrees of culpability for principals, as opposed to parties as previously mentioned, the Supreme Court of Canada in Paquette used the principal/party distinction in relation to which form of the defence of duress is available in a given context.  The Court has not resiled from that position in subsequent cases from Hibbert through to Ryan.

[31]                     In three decisions between 1974 and 1987, the House of Lords and the Privy Council wrestled with whether, at common law, duress can be a defence to the offence of murder (see Lynch; Abbott v The Queen, [1977] AC 755 (PC); and Howe).  In Lynch, by a majority of three to two, the House of Lords accepted that the common law did not bar a party, as opposed to a principal, from raising the defence of duress to a charge of murder.  In Abbott, by a majority of three to two, the Privy Council rejected the idea of extending the defence of duress to principals charged with murder.  Finally, in Howe the House of Lords unanimously overruled Lynch and held that, at common law, the defence of duress is not available to anyone charged with murder.  More recently in R v Z, [2005] UKHL 22 at para 21, [2005] 2 AC 467 (Eng) (hereafter Hasan), the House of Lords restated its conclusion in Howe.

[32]                     The scope of the defence of duress at common law for parties on a charge of murder has not been stated as categorically by the Supreme Court of Canada as it has been in England since Lynch was overruled.  There are, however, decisions from the Courts of Appeal of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario that have allowed an accused charged as a party to raise the common law defence of duress to the offence of murder, even after the House of Lords overruled Lynch (see R v Aravena (M) et al, 2015 ONCA 250 at para 32, 333 OAC 264, leave to appeal to the SCC refused, 2016 CanLII 18897; 2016 CanLII 18905; and 2016 CanLII 18914).  In Ryan, the Court makes the point that the common law in Canada as to what, if any, offences are excluded from the defence of duress is currently “unclear” (at para 83).

[33]                     It is unnecessary on the facts of this case to decide whether the common law in Canada on the defence of duress to a charge of murder is currently reflective of the view in Lynch or Howe, or alternatively, state what the common law ought to be.  The legal distinction between principals and parties as to the defence of duress is, subject to Parliament amending section 17 of the Code, for the Supreme Court of Canada to vary.  More importantly, in my view, the constitutional issues in this appeal can be decided on the interpretation given to the Code in Paquette, the principle of moral involuntariness as discussed in Perka, Ruzic and Ryan and the principle of overbreadth.

[34]                     To those introductory comments, some words of warning need also be stated.

[35]                     The question of the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder is highly controversial.  There is no consensus in common law jurisdictions (or internationally) as to what the relationship should be between the defence of duress and the offence of murder, although the starting point for each common law jurisdiction has been the common law as articulated by Hale.  The lack of consensus to this divisive legal question is not surprising because, as Professor Joshua Dressler eruditely explains, “Duress always is a matter of line drawing about which reasonable minds can differ” (Joshua Dressler, “Exegesis of the Law of Duress:  Justifying the Excuse and Searching for its Proper Limits” (1989) 62 S Cal L Rev 1331 at 1367).  A similar view was taken by the Supreme Court of New Zealand in Akulue v R, [2013] NZSC 88, [2014] 1 NZLR 17 (NZLII), where the Court stated, “The shape of the defence of [duress] has always been affected by policy considerations” (at para 11) (see also Howe at pp 453-54).

[36]                     Some have long advocated for the end of Hale’s rule.  For example, in section 2.09 of the American Law Institute, Model Penal Code:  Official Draft and Explanatory Notes (Philadelphia:  The American Law Institute, 1985) online:  www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/western-europe-others/UnitedStatesofAmerica/Model%20Penal%20Code%20United‌%20States%20of%20America%201962.pdf, duress is recognized as a defence to all offences (including murder) committed as a result of the threat of unlawful force by another that “a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist”.  While the wisdom of Parliament’s policy choice to exclude duress as a defence to the offence of murder is a fertile source of discussion, that debate is beyond this appeal.  It is for Parliament to define the criminal law in terms of the nature of both offences and defences, subject only to constitutional review (see Ruzic at para 23).

[37]                     It is also noteworthy that this appeal relates solely to the offence of murder, and not to any of the other many offences listed in section 17 of the Code for which Parliament has determined that the defence of duress is also excluded.  That is significant because the purpose of the murder exception to the defence of duress is not, in my view, the same as the other offences listed in section 17, with the debatable exception of attempted murder.  Also, the discussion of the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness is materially different in relation to murder than the other offences listed in section 17 of the Code.

[38]                     Finally, before moving to a discussion of the history of this appeal and the background of the defence of duress, something needs to be said about hypotheticals.  A survey of the literature about the defence of duress evidences that judges and other writers commonly resort to the use of hypotheticals.  One of the first to use this technique was Aristotle.  In distinguishing what is involuntary from conduct that is voluntary in Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle, translated by David Ross (London, UK:  Oxford University Press, 1963), Aristotle stated (at pp 48-49):

But with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater evils or for some noble object (e.g. if a tyrant were to order one to do something base, having one’s parents and children in his power, and if one did the action they were to be saved, but otherwise would be put to death), it may be debated whether such actions are involuntary or voluntary.  Something of the sort happens also with regard to the throwing of goods overboard in a storm; for in the abstract no one throws goods away voluntarily, but on condition of its securing the safety of himself and his crew any sensible man does so.

 

[39]                     Versions of Aristotle’s “tyrant” (at p 209) or Lord Morris’s “gangster-tyrant” (Lynch at p 670) have appeared in countless hypotheticals about duress.  What is pertinent in this appeal is not the possibility, based on an elaborate and unrealistic catch-22 scenario, that a particularly diabolic villain may compel an ordinary person to murder an innocent person.  Laws are to be constitutionally evaluated on the basis of reasonable hypotheticals, not on the basis of fantastic and remote situations (see R v Nur, 2015 SCC 15 at paras 54-62, [2015] 1 SCR 773; R v Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59 at para 28, [2015] 3 SCR 754).  The correct perspective to apply in this appeal is whether it is reasonably foreseeable, based on experience and common sense, that the exclusion of murder from the defence of duress will result in criminal liability for an action that is morally involuntary, or that the law is overbroad to its purpose.

Decision of the Trial Judge

[40]                     The trial judge rejected the argument that section 17 of the Code, in the case of murder, is inconsistent with the principle of moral involuntariness for essentially three reasons, which he summarized as follows (at para 37):

(1)     Proportionality is inherent in the principle that we should not punish morally involuntary conduct.  It is never proportional to sacrifice an innocent life in order to avoid the mere possibility of threats being carried out;

 

(2)     There remains a widely-held and deeply-rooted belief in our society that human life has an intrinsic value and is inviolable.  Accordingly, the principles of fundamental justice must give significant weight to the sanctity of life.  The life of a murder victim must be equally protected by s. 7 of the Charter;

(3)     The long-standing societal consensus in Canada and other similar jurisdictions is that duress cannot excuse murder.  While some debate may exist whether it should apply to all parties, the societal consensus has never been questioned in regard to perpetrators.

 

[41]                     In reaching his conclusion, the trial judge declined to follow the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Aravena.  Aravena dealt with the mass murder of several members of a criminal organization committed by other members of the same group.  Three of the accused performed lookout functions while the murders were committed and then assisted in cleanup of the crime scene; they were parties to the murders.  The trial judge in that case refused to allow the three accused to raise the common law defence of duress for two reasons.  He concluded that the defence was not available to them after Howe (given the effect that decision has on the underlying reasoning in Paquette).  Also, he ruled that killing an innocent person based on duress fails the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness (see R v Sandham (2009), 70 CR (6th) 203 (Ont Sup Ct J) at paras 57, 70, 110).

[42]                     The Court of Appeal decided that the trial judge in Aravena erred in his interpretation of Paquette.  The Court held that the common law defence of duress is available to persons charged with the offence of murder as a party (see para 40).  The Court of Appeal also concluded that the trial judge erred in concluding that the importance society gives to the sanctity of life of innocent victims always makes it disproportionate for their life to be taken by an accused claiming to have acted under duress (see para 84).  Although the trial judge in Aravena (see paras 123-24 of Sandham) declined to decide the further issue of whether the statutory exclusion of the defence of duress to the offence of murder in section 17 of the Code infringed the Charter, the Court of Appeal in Aravena made an obiter comment about the provision’s constitutionality (at para 86):

 

The constitutionality of the murder exception to the duress defence in s. 17 of the Charter is not before the court.  However, it follows from this analysis that, subject to any argument the Crown might advance justifying the exception as it applies to perpetrators under s. 1 of the Charter, the exception must be found unconstitutional.

 

[43]                     In declining to follow Aravena, the trial judge raised several concerns he had with the decision (see para 26 of his reasons).  To begin, in his view, the Court of Appeal failed to address the problem of excusing the certainty of death of an innocent victim on the mere risk of grave harm in its consideration of the proportionality requirement of moral involuntariness.  Second, the Court of Appeal failed to address the argument that self defence is a realistic choice as an alternative to murdering an innocent person.  Finally, he concluded that the distinction between a principal and a party in the case of the offence of murder supports the constitutionality of section 17.

[44]                     The trial judge also came to the alternative conclusion that if section 17 of the Code violated section 7 of the Charter, such a violation was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter because the statutory prohibition of the defence of duress in the case of murder was necessary for the “objective of protecting the life innocent victims who have no wish to die” (at para 85).

Background to the Defence of Duress

[45]                     The law against the defence of duress being available for the offence of murder is a longstanding one that needs to be understood in context.  The starting point is of course Hale.  Hale’s 17th century articulation of the law has greatly influenced the common law world to this day.  Also important is that the drafting of what is now section 17 of the Code is a bi-product of the unsuccessful attempt to create an English Penal Code in the late 19th century.  To that I would add that, although Canada has taken a restrictive approach generally to the defence of duress compared to other jurisdictions (see Don Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law:  A Treatise, 7th ed (Toronto:  Carswell, 2014) at 524), on the question relevant to this appeal, the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder, as committed by a principal (or co-principal), the Canadian perspective is shared by many other parts of the common law world.  The final bit of background context is what is meant by the principle of moral involuntariness for the purposes of section 7 of the Charter.

Hale’s Understanding of Duress

[46]                     Hale confronted the situation of the taking of innocent life due to duress with these words (Hale at p 51):

 

Again, if a man be desperately assaulted, and in peril of death, and cannot otherwise escape, unless to satisfy his assailant’s fury he will kill an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force will not acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit the fact; for he ought rather to die himself, than kill an innocent:  but if he cannot otherwise safe his own life, the law permits him in his own defence to kill the assailant; for by the violence of the assault, and the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself, the law of nature, and necessity hath made him his own protector cum debito moderamine inculpatae tutelae, as shall be farther shewed, when we come to the chapter of homicide se defendendo.

 

[47]                     Properly understood, Hale says that, when one is threatened by another and is faced with the choice of kill or be killed, one has two options if they cannot otherwise escape—sacrifice oneself or act in self-defence.  According to Hale, unless the person chooses sacrifice or self-defence, they should be properly convicted and punished for murder.  Later in the 18th century, Hale’s understanding of duress was approved by another eminent jurist, Sir William Blackstone (William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, 16th ed (London, UK:  A Strahan for T Cadell in the Strand & J Butterworth and Son, 1825) vol 4 at 21).

[48]                     The views of Hale and Blackstone are based on the deontological perspective of moral absolutism.  In their view, because of the importance of the sanctity of human life, certain strict standards of conduct are required that do not vary with the circumstances.  Thus, according to Hale, no one may take a life except in self-defence.  This perspective has a long tradition in the criminal law.  Lord Brooke made the point in A (Children) (Conjoined Twins:  Surgical Separation), Re, [2000] EWCA Civ 254, [2000] 4 All ER 961, that when the criminal law was the responsibility of the judiciary to develop, judges were “steeped in the Judaeo-Christian tradition” and used those moral principles to develop the criminal law until Parliament took over (at p 1024).

[49]                     At the end of the 19th century, another judge of similar stature, Sir James Stephen, confirmed that, what meager jurisprudence there was on duress after Hale stated the law was consistent with his view (see James Fitzjames Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England (London, UK:  MacMillan and Company, 1883) vol 2 at 106-7; and William Holdsworth, A History of English Law (London, UK:  Methuen & Co & Sweet and Maxwell, 1966) vol 8 at 444).

[50]                     While Stephen, a utilitarian, opposed the idea of duress being a defence to any crime, and favoured the idea that it should be a factor relevant only to mitigating sentence, he conceded that Hale’s view that duress is not a defence to the offence of murder was defensible.  Stephen stated that, “Surely it is at the moment when temptation to crime is strongest that the law should speak most clearly and emphatically to the contrary” (at p 107).

[51]                     In the decade before Canada adopted the Code, five judges of the Queen’s Bench Division gave their judgment in the notorious and influential case of Reg v Dudley and Stephens (1884), 14 QBD 273 (CA (Eng)), involving shipwrecked sailors adrift in the ocean murdering a young cabin boy and resorting to cannibalism before their rescue.  That decision casts its long shadow on the defences of duress and necessity to modern times.

[52]                     The question before the Court in Dudley and Stephens was whether “in order to save your own life you may lawfully take away the life of another, when that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours, nor is guilty of any illegal act whatever towards you or any one else” (at p 281).

[53]                     In answering the question in the negative, Lord Coleridge CJ on behalf of the Court, confirmed that the defence of necessity was not available in the case of the intentional killing of another person.  In coming to that conclusion he relied, in part, on Hale’s reasoning regarding whether duress was a defence to the offence of murder.  This judicial endorsement of Hale’s understanding of duress in Dudley and Stephens has had an enormous impact on the law of duress going forward (and some would argue that consequence has been unfortunate) (see Joshua Dressler, “Reflections on Dudley and Stephens and killing the innocent:  taking a wrong conceptual path” in Dennis J Baker & Jeremy Horder, eds, The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law:  The Legacy of Glanville Williams (Cambridge, UK:  Cambridge University Press, 2013) 126 at 128-29; Howe at pp 429-31 per Lord Hailsham LC; Holdsworth at p 445; Fletcher at pp 823-27).

[54]                     Appropriate caution needs to be taken with Lord Coleridge’s judgment in Dudley and Stephens, as there is no analysis in the decision of whether the taking of an innocent life to avoid a harm posed by a grave external danger might be excused, even if it cannot be justified.  Lord Coleridge used the two terms “excuse” and “justification” interchangeably in his reasons.  The conceptual distinction between justifications and excuses was unimportant in his era.  Like Hale, Lord Coleridge takes a strict deontological approach to the law, that a person cannot murder an innocent person to avoid harm.  Rather, one has a duty to avoid murdering an innocent person.  This view subscribes to the perspective that, while law and morality are not the same thing, the two cannot be completely divorced when the consequence of an action is the taking of an innocent life (see Dudley and Stephens at p 287; Howe at pp 430, 456; and Fletcher at pp 826-27).

[55]                     Also relevant to this appeal are the difficult and provocative questions Lord Coleridge raises about the taking of innocent human life.  He states (at p 287):

 

It is not needful to point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been contended for.  Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity?  By what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured?  Is it to be strength, or intellect, or what?  It is plain that the principle leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will justify him in deliberately taking another’s life to save his own.

 

[56]                     Professor Glanville Williams describes Dudley and Stephens as a “dramatic illustration of the difference between utilitarian and deontological ethics” (Glanville Williams, “A Commentary on R. v. Dudley and Stephens” (1977) 8 Cambrian L Rev 94).  While Williams, a utilitarian, was critical of Dudley and Stephens, he did acknowledge that Lord Coleridge’s concern about the problem of the choosing of the victim was “one satisfying reason” in the decision (Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, 2nd ed (London, UK:  Stevens & Sons, 1961) at 744).

The Influence of the English Draft Penal Code on Section 17 of the Code

[57]                     The reason why Canada has a statutory defence of duress begins with the efforts in England by Stephen and others during Prime Minister Disraeli’s second administration (1874-80) to create an English penal code that would consolidate and codify the criminal law (see Rupert Cross, “The Making of English Criminal Law (6) Sir James Fitzjames Stephen” [1978] Crim L Rev 652 at 656-57; generally, Desmond H Brown, The Genesis of the Canadian Criminal Code of 1892 (Toronto:  University of Toronto Press, 1989); and Graham Parker, “The Origins of the Canadian Criminal Code” in David H Flaherty, ed, Essays in the History of Canadian Law (Toronto:  Osgoode Society, 1981) 249).

[58]                     The first draft of the English Penal Code was introduced in Parliament in 1878 and was based primarily on the early writings of James Fitzjames Stephen, A Digest of the Criminal Law:  Crimes and Punishments 3rd ed (London, UK:  MacMillan and Co, 1877) (see Bill 178, A Bill to establish a Code of Indictable Offences, and the Procedure relating thereto, 41 Vic, 1878).  In that proposed law, the formulation of duress was quite different from what was stated by Hale.  As Stephen had previously advocated, Bill 178 did not recognize duress as an exculpatory defence to any offence; rather, when the circumstances of duress as set out in the statute were satisfied the effect was only a mitigation of punishment (see section 22).

[59]                     Given the enormity of the idea of codifying centuries of criminal law, the Disraeli government decided to withdraw Bill 178 from Parliament and appoint a Royal Commission to study the Bill and make recommendations (Brown at p 33).  Four Commissioners were appointed, including Stephen.  They presented their report to Parliament in 1879, recommending substantial revisions (see UK, Report of the Royal Commission Appointed to Consider The Law Relating to Indictable Offences:  With an Appendix Containing a Draft Code Embodying the Suggestions of the Commissioners (London, UK:  Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1879) (the Report)).

[60]                     In the Report, the Commissioners abandoned adopting Stephen’s view of duress.  They advised Parliament that, “We have framed section 23 of the Draft Code to express what we think is the existing law, and what at all events we suggest ought to be the law” (the Report at p 43) (emphasis added).  In summary, the Commissioners’ view of the law of duress was a restatement of the common law of duress as stated by Hale, and an aspirational view of what they believed the law of duress should be (see Reg v Gotts, [1992] 2 AC 412 (HL) at 434; and Lynch at p 684).

[61]                     The Commissioners recommended maintaining duress as an excuse to the commission of an offence, contrary to Stephen’s earlier suggestion.  The Report also recommended codifying Hale’s “stern rule” that duress is no defence to the offence of murder (at p 43; and Lynch at p 701).  The Report also recommended excluding the defence of duress from other offences listed in the Report to be of “a heinous character” (at p 43).  This list was more restrictive of the defence than had previously been the case at common law.  Finally, the defence was taken away from anyone who was party to a conspiracy or association which rendered him or her subject to compulsion.  The Report formed the basis of various bills in 1879 and 1880 regarding the draft English Penal Code that were never passed (see Cross at p 657).

[62]                     After Confederation, Prime Minister MacDonald saw uniformity in the criminal law as a necessity for Canada (see Parker at p 252).  His and other governments pursued a policy of harmonizing the criminal law in the Dominion through codification.  Ultimately Sir John Thompson, then Attorney General of Canada and Minister of Justice, was able to achieve that goal by shepherding the first version of the Code through Parliament in 1892 (The Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29).  Thompson made it clear in his comments regarding the Code on second reading that it had many influences, including the work of the Commissioners in England (see House of Commons Debates, 7th Parl, 2nd Sess, No 1 (12 April 1892) at 1312 (Sir John Thompson)).  That is clearly the case in terms of the defence of duress.

[63]                     The Canadian version of the defence of duress in 1892 mirrored the version recommended by the Commissioners in the Report (see J LI J Edwards, “Compulsion, Coercion and Criminal Responsibility” (1951) 14:3 Mod L Rev 297 at 300).

[64]                     Parliament has done little substantively, in terms of duress, since 1892, except lengthen the list of excluded offences from the original version of the statute.  The Royal Commission on Revision of the Criminal Code in the 1950s did not recommend to Parliament any revision of the law of duress (see Debates of the Senate, 21st Parl, 6th Sess, No 1 (14 May 1952) at 229 (Hon Élie Beauregard).

[65]                     During the debate in Parliament in 1954 about the revised Code, the Hon Stuart S Garson, Attorney General of Canada and Minister of Justice, stated that the wording of section 17 of the Code had “stood the test of time” and the government had no intention of substantively revising it (see House of Commons Debates, 22nd Parl, 1st Sess, No 2 (19 January 1954) at 1256).

[66]                     More recently there has been a call for legislative reform.  In the 1980s, the Law Reform Commission of Canada (the LRCC) advocated narrowing the statutory limitations on the defence of duress, and ending the distinction as to the availability of the defence between principals and parties created by the Paquette decision.  The LRCC’s recommendations, however, included maintaining the law that would exclude duress as a defence to conduct that would cover the offence of murder (see Law Reform Commission of Canada, Criminal Law, The General Part:  Liability and Defences, Working Paper No 29, Catalogue No J32-1/29-1982 (Ottawa:  Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1982) at 87-88; Law Reform Commission of Canada, Recodifying Criminal Law, Report 31, Catalogue No J31-51/1987 (Ottawa:  Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1987) at 35).  The LRCC’s version of the defence of duress has strong parallels to the common law as stated in Howe.

[67]                     In 1993, the federal government released a white paper on proposals to amend Part I of the Code, including the defence of duress.  The proposal would have created a single statutory defence of duress that applied to both duress by threats or duress of circumstances.  The new defence would apply to any offence, except murder.  It also envisaged codification of the common law requirements of duress.  No legislative action was taken, as the government was defeated in the election later that year.  Subsequent governments to this day have shown no interest in redefining the defence of duress (see Minister of Justice of Canada, “Proposals to Amend the Criminal Code (General Principles)”, White Paper (Ottawa:  Department of Justice Canada, 28 June 1993) at 11-12).

The Approach of Other Common Law Jurisdictions

[68]                     As previously mentioned, the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder in the common law world has consistently begun with Hale’s rule that, at common law, duress is not a defence to the offence of murder (e.g., US v LaFleur, 971 F (2d) 200 at 204-5 (9th Cir 1991); Commonwealth v Vasquez, 462 Mass 827 at 834-35 (Sup Jud Ct 2012); and Akulue at para 12).  From that starting point, there are four different approaches in the common law world today as to the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder, leaving aside the question of different rules in the case of principals and parties.

[69]                     To begin, England (Howe and Hasan) together with some jurisdictions in Australia (e.g., South Australia—R v Brown and Morley, [1968] SASR 467); and the United States (e.g., Maryland—McMillan v State of Maryland, 428 Md 333 (CA 2009)), have left the question of whether duress is a defence to murder entirely to the common law based on Hale’s rule.

[70]                     A second group of jurisdictions such as New Zealand (e.g., Crimes Act 1961 (NZ), 1961/43 section 24), parts of Australia (e.g., Queensland—Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) section 31) and the United States (e.g., Oregon—Or Rev Stat § 161.270), have taken an approach similar to Canada and have codified Hale’s rule into their criminal law such that duress is not a defence to the offence of murder.

[71]                     When considering American jurisdictions that have followed Hale’s rule and denied the defence of duress for murder by statute or the common law, some of those jurisdictions may allow it for the special case of where an accused is charged with murder arising from an unintended death of another occurring during the commission of a serious violent crime; what is often called the felony murder rule or constructive murder (e.g., California—People v Anderson, 28 Cal (4th) 767 (Sup Ct 2002) at 784; and Maryland—McMillan).  This approach to the defence of duress is similar to what occurred in Canada after Paquette was decided, and continued thereafter until the question of duress for constructive murder situations involving a party became moot after the decision in R v Logan, 1990 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1990] 2 SCR 731.  In Logan, the Court held that because section 7 of the Charter mandates that a conviction for murder only occurs if there is subjective foresight of death of the victim, any law that allows for a party charged with murder to be convicted on any lesser degree of mens rea is unconstitutional.

[72]                     A third group of jurisdictions in Australia (e.g., Western Australia—Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913 (WA), s 32) and the United States (e.g., Texas—Tex Penal Code § 8.05) have followed the approach in the Model Penal Code and have legislated that duress is a defence available to any offence, including murder.

[73]                     Finally, Minnesota (Minn Stat § 609.08 and § 609.20(3)), Wisconsin (Wis Stat § 939.46) and New Jersey (NJ Stat § 2C:2-9) have, through legislation, adopted a hybrid approach.  Duress is a partial defence to murder (like provocation) that may, if successful, reduce a charge of murder to a lesser form of culpability, such as manslaughter.

[74]                     While this comparative survey provides little in the way of answers to the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder, the literature leads me to two general observations relevant to this appeal.  The first is that Hale’s rule continues to have legitimacy in the eyes of a majority of common law jurisdictions to this day, regardless of whether one thinks that it is good or bad policy.  It is not fair to say that the rule is outdated simply because of its age.  The second observation I would make is that, where reform of Hale’s rule has occurred, it has been done mainly in the legislatures, not the courts.  Of course the common law world is not the only perspective on the relationship between the defence of duress and the offence of murder, which is an argument the accused has raised that I will deal with later.

Perka, Ruzic and Ryan—The Principle of Moral Involuntariness

[75]                     It is a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter that no one may be convicted of an offence based on an involuntary act because of the importance of autonomy in the attribution of criminal liability (see Ruzic at paras 43-47).  The Charter recognizes involuntariness in terms of both physical involuntariness and moral involuntariness.  LeBel J explains moral involuntariness as a principle of fundamental justice this way in Ruzic (at para 47):

 

It is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary conduct – behaviour that is the product of a free will and controlled body, unhindered by external constraints – should attract the penalty and stigma of criminal liability.  Depriving a person of liberty and branding her with the stigma of criminal liability would infringe the principles of fundamental justice if the accused did not have any realistic choice.  The ensuing deprivation of liberty and stigma would have been imposed in violation of the tenets of fundamental justice and would thus infringe s. 7 of the Charter.

 

                                          [emphasis added]

 

[76]                     Moral involuntariness can be traced back at least as far as the philosophy of Aristotle that pardon should be granted “when one does a wrongful act under pressure which overstrains human nature and which no one could withstand” (Aristotle at p 49; see Fletcher at pp 802-03).

[77]                     The idea of moral involuntariness is that the choice of disobeying the law cannot be said to be that of the individual, because it is not the product of his or her own free will.  Aristotle says but for the external circumstances compelling the act, “no one would choose any such act in itself” (Aristotle at p 49).  Dressler explains the concept by stating that, “the actor is normal, but that some external factor has acted on her in a way that causes us to say that she did not have a fair opportunity to act lawfully” (Dressler, “Reflections on Dudley and Stephens” at p 144).  Professor John Gardner explains the relationship between the defence of duress and moral involuntariness in this way (John Gardner, “Reply to Critics” in Offences and Defences—Selected Essays in the Philosophy of Criminal Law (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 2007) 239 (at pp 267-68):

 

One’s will is overborne in the relevant sense, when someone else, by issuing a conditional threat, intentionally creates a reason (or what one reasonably takes to be a reason) for one to ϕ, and one ϕs for that reason, and one could not reasonably have been expected to do otherwise than to ϕ for that reason.  The reasonableness of one’s reaction is, in short, a necessary condition of the overbearing of one’s will.

 

[78]                     Ruzic, and prior English decisions, have used similar language to Gardner, and have described morally involuntary conduct as when the individual’s will to choose is “overborne . . . by the threats of another” or is “constrained by some external force” (Ruzic at paras 44, 46; see also Regina v Hudson; Regina v Taylor, [1971] 2 QBD 202 at 206 (CA (Eng)); and Lynch at p 686).

[79]                     When the law speaks of an individual’s will, it is not a question of whether a particular person is either stalwart or timid.  The law inserts an objective requirement to set the standard of expected behaviour as individuals not only enjoy rights, but also owe duties to others; a person must calibrate their conduct reasonably to threats.  Accordingly, as LeBel J explained in Ruzic, people are “expected to demonstrate some fortitude and to put up a normal resistance to the threat” (at para 62).

[80]                     A morally involuntary action is, however, not a morally blameless action; the act committed is not innocent, only that it would be unjust in the circumstances to stigmatize and punish the actor (see Ruzic at para 41).

[81]                     While the law appreciates that difficult circumstances can produce great temptations, the mere fact that a person is faced with a hard or agonizing choice because of an external danger is not enough to make their subsequent action morally involuntary.  The law does not take an entirely idiosyncratic view, because the interests at stake are larger (see Ruzic at para 58).  Rather, moral involuntariness is about not having “any realistic choice” (emphasis added) in the circumstances but to commit the criminal offence (Ruzic at para 47; see also Ryan at para 40).

[82]                     What does it mean to have no realistic choice but to disobey the law when facing an external danger?  The leading decision on this question is Perka, a case involving the defence of necessity, where the Court adopted the Aristotelian perspective of Fletcher.  Dickson J (as he then was), for the majority, explains that, whether one has a realistic choice to excuse breaking the law due to an external danger has two qualities.  To begin, there must be “no reasonable legal alternative” to breaking the law in the circumstances, otherwise the action is voluntary (at p 252).  Also, even if there is no reasonable legal alternative, the harm caused by disobeying the law cannot be disproportionate to the benefit accrued by avoiding the external danger (see pp 252-53; and Fletcher at pp 802-07).

[83]                     Justices LeBel and Cromwell summarize the proportionality assessment this way in Ryan (at paras 72-73):

 

In other words, the “moral voluntariness” of an act must depend on whether it is proportional to the threatened harm.  To determine if the proportionality requirement is met, two elements must be considered:  the difference between the nature and magnitude of the harm threatened and the offence committed, as well as a general moral judgment regarding the accused’s behaviour in the circumstances.  These elements are to be evaluated in conjunction on a modified objective basis.

 

The first element of proportionality requires that the harm threatened was equal to or greater than the harm inflicted by the accused (Ruzic, at para. 62; see also R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 31).  The second element of proportionality requires a more in-depth analysis of the acts of the accused and a determination as to whether they accord with what society expects from a reasonable person similarly situated in that particular circumstance.  It is at this stage that we examine if the accused demonstrated “normal” resistance to the threat.  Given that the defence of duress “evolved from attempts at striking a proper balance between those conflicting interests of the accused, of the victims and of society” (Ruzic, at para. 60), proportionality measured on a modified objective standard is key.

 

[84]                     In Ruzic, the Court struck down the immediacy and presence requirements in section 17 of the Code as being an infringement of the principle of moral involuntariness.  The Court determined that those two parts of section 17 violated the principle of moral involuntariness because they restricted the defence of duress from being raised for threats of future harm or in situations when the person issuing threats would harm a third party, such as a family member taken hostage, at a different location than where the offence was committed (see paras 53-54).  The result was that section 17 was underinclusive (see para 90).

[85]                     In both Ruzic and Ryan the Court left open the question of whether the list of excluded offences in section 17 of the Code is in conformity with the principle of moral voluntariness.
