[34]           The period of ineligibility for parole is governed by the provisions of Section 745.4 of the Criminal Code which states:

 

Subject to section 745.5, at the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.2, by order, substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than twenty‑five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.

 

[35]           The seminal case dealing with this section is R. v. Shopshire (1995) 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 43 C.R. (4th) 269 (S.C.C.). In that decision, Justice Iacobucci, writing for the Court, stated in para. 29 as follows:

 

In my opinion, a more appropriate standard, which would better reflect the intentions of Parliament, can be stated in this manner: as a general rule, the period of parole ineligibility shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in s. 744 [now s. 745], the offender should wait a longer period before having his suitability to be released into the general public assessed.  To this end, an extension of the period of parole ineligibility would not be "unusual", although it may well be that, in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be awarded.

 

[36]           In his submissions, Crown counsel argued that the primary sentencing objectives in this case ought to be denunciation, deterrence (both specific and general), and separating Mr. Osei-Agyemang from society. (s. 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada)

 

[37]           In that regard, he pointed to Mr. Osei-Agyemang’s criminal record which commenced in 2001 in Youth Court in Montreal. On April 4, 2005, he was convicted in Youth Court of one count of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence and one count of robbery.

 

[38]           His subsequent record as an adult is as follows:

[39]           At the time he murdered Clifton Anderson, Mr. Osei-Agyemang was the subject of two outstanding probation orders.

 

[40]           Section 745.4 of the Criminal Code mandates four matters to be considered by the sentencing judge. These are:

 

·                     the character of the offender,

·                     the nature of the offence,

·                     the circumstances surrounding its commission, and

·                     the recommendation of the jury.
