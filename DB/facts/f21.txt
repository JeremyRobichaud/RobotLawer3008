 The facts related to us are that the appellant’s brother and others obtained some forty thousand dollars in an armed robbery of a credit union. This was on a Thursday. They were apprehended by the police within a few hours with some twenty thousand dollars in their possesion. The appellant was disturbed when he heard of his brother’s implication in the robbery and by the fact that some of the money taken had not been recovered. Through telephone conversations with his brother he found out where the balance of the monies had been hidden and went and recovered it. Over seventeen thousand dollars in marked bills and other scrip was in a purple athletic bag.

All three were jointly charged and tried for possession of stolen property. The jury found the appellant guilty of the offence but found his friends not guilty. The trial judge then imposed the sentence appealed from.
